.\FADE IN:
.\Int. Martial arts arena - day
>.A crowded martial arts arena on the day of a big kung fu
>.tournament, the stands packed with noisy spectators, the
>.atmosphere circus-like. The walls are festooned with
>.banners, and lights are trained on the center mat. There is
>.no title card to indicate the date, but it is clear from the
..fashions of the audience that this is the late 1970s.
>.On this mat we see, on one side, TONY KONG, mid twenties,
>.Chinese, a hard-edged, leanly muscled athlete in peak
>.condition, like a vicious Bruce Lee. Sweat drips off him; he
>.wears white robes with a black belt. Intense but in control,
..sure of himself and his abilities. 
>.Across the ring is his BOUT OPPONENT, a bit older, a burly
>.Asian man towering over Tony. A  broad, greedy face with a
..lack of restraint and a lack of grace; Tony's foil.
>.The referee signals for them to begin. The bout opponent
..bows quickly and insincerely; Tony bows with calm control. 
>.The bout opponent immediately charges at Tony, who quickly
..parries his attack. 
>.Though his opponent's blows land with massive force, Tony is
..too quick to be hit. 
>.He deflects several of the bout opponent's hits before
..pouncing upon a weak spot and HITTING him on the side. 
>.Tony's fighting is as stylized and graceful as the dancing
..of a ballerina, in the way of an old Hong Kong movie.
>.The bout opponent backs up for relief, and we pan over the
..crowds, cheering on their champion. 
>.We focus upon a pretty, fashionably dressed young Asian
>.woman smiling and cheering wildly; she appears to be his
..wife. 
>.The bout opponent attack Tony again and again is deflected.
>.Tony is in control. He moves around the mat now, searching
>.for a weak spot in his exhausted opponent. His opponent
>.makes a misstep, and Tony punishes him dearly. His
>.opponent's face is bewildered and angry at being
..overmatched. 
..                                                 CLOSE ON
..Tony's face, staring down his man with the eyes of a killer.
.\Int. TONY's APARTMENT - day (30 years later)
>.We see the same view of TONY's face, now old and hardened
>.through years of weathering. The look of controlled
..intensity replaced by one of ennui. 
>.He is now an old man, alone in a shabby apartment. He wears
>.a white tanktop to show his still lean frame. While still no
>.one to fuck with, with his gray stubble and unkempt hair he
..clearly hasn't taken care of himself in years.
..TITLE CARD "THE CHOSEN ONE OF CHINATOWN"
>.Credits roll as sunlight streams into his cramped and dingy
>.apartment. There is a small bookshelf and an old TV, but no
>.trophies, medals, or other signs of his former kung fu
..glory--except for two framed photos.
>.One shows Tony as a young man clad in robes, standing with
>.his wife after a tournament win. Next to it is a photo of a
>.family standing around a distinctive temple arch in a
>.village in China; it is Tony as a child in his family's
..ancestral village, one we will see again.
.\Int. Tony's apartment - kitchen - day
>.Tony walks over to his messy kitchen, pours himself a mug of
>.tea from a kettle, and grabs a piece of toast from the
..toaster. 
>.He rummages around in the shelf above the sink, but pulls
>.out an empty bottle of bourbon. Sighing, he tosses the
..bottle onto a huge pile of glass next to his trashcan.
>.Tony sourly drinks his alcohol-less coffee and eats the
>.toast while reading the the San Francisco Chronicle at his
>.table. As he brushes his teeth and changes into a beat-up
>.brown leather jacket and jeans, we sense the mundanity of
..his life.
.\EXT. chinatown street - day
>.Now afternoon, Tony meanders down the streets and passes a
>.few Chinese businesses and markets filled with odd fruits
>.and vegetables. The atmosphere feels relaxed and neighborly,
>.if a little shabby, like a relaxed village transported into
..a major city.
>.He walks by a group of children playing, who immediately
..stop when they see him and run away giggling.
>.As he passes the various businesses he nods and smiles wryly
>.at many of the older shopowners and patrons. At one market
>.DONNA HU, late 50s, a genial, gracefully aged female
..shopowner, and her friend WAN-MIN recognize him and smiles.
._DONNA
.:Good to see you this morning, Tony!
._WAN-MIN
>:Isn't it a little early for you to
.:be up and about?
..Tony glances at them and smiles, not bothering to parry.
._Tony
.:Good morning, ladies.
..Donna laughs with Wan-Min.
._DONNA
>:You think he knows it's not
.:morning?
>.Tony continues past the market. A souped-up Honda, playing
>.loud music and driven by two tough-looking teenagers, drives
..by him slowly.
.\INT. benny's Liquor store - continuous
>.Tony nods to the owner, BENNY, mid 50s, a friendly-looking
>.man. Tony glances around the store, seeing only two tattooed
>.wannabe-tough teenagers, YOUTH #1 and YOUTH #2 (the same who
..drove by earlier), browsing by the flavored vodka.
._Benny
>:A pretty day outside for you to
.:come in here.
._TONY
>:It's just as pretty as all the
.:other days.
._BENNY
.((smiles)
>:Is that why you're here every day,
.:Tony?
..Tony stops for a moment to look at Benny.
._TONY
.:How's Victoria doing, Benny?
._BENNY
>:Oh, she's fine. Just finished up
>:her first year at UCLA. I guess I
>:should be thanking you for helping
.:pay her tuition!
._TONY
.((sarcastic)
>:You know me, I do all I can to
.:help.
>.Tony turns away to search for some whiskey. He walks by the
>.two youths, who give the older man an amused and
>.condescending look. Tony tries to ignore the look and looks
>.up and down the store aisles, placing his finger on the
..bottles as he brushes by them.
>.The youths continue talking and laughing and Youth #1 lights
..a cigarette.
._BENNY
.:Excuse me! You can't smoke in here. 
..They stop talking and look over, surprised.
._YOUTH #1
.:What's that, boss?
..Benny looks uncomfortable.
._BENNY
>:I'm sorry, but you can't smoke in
>:here. See that sign over there? I
.:can't have this in my store.
._YOUTH #1
.:What you talking about, man?
._YOUTH #2
.:It's just one cig.
._YOUTH #1
.:It ain't gonna hurt your store.
._YOUTH #2
>:You really got a problem with one
.:cig?
._BENNY
.:I know, I know, but...
._YOUTH #2
>:What, you got a problem with us?
.:That it?
._YOUTH #1
>:I'm your customer, you're supposed
.:to be helping me out, man.
._BENNY
.:Listen, it's just the store rules.
>.Tony, standing by a shelf, looks over to the counter, where
>.the two youths are now standing threateningly in front of
..Benny, who looks smaller than ever. Tony looks conflicted.
._YOUTH #2
>:I think you gotta change these
.:store rules.
._YOUTH #1
>:You don't want to be pissing off
.:your customers, do you?
._YOUTH #2
>:You don't want to be fucking with
>:us, no way. You fuck with us, you
.:fuck with Clarence Tran.
>.Benny shrinks away, clearly fearful upon the mention of that
..name. Youth #2 seems pleased with his bravado.
._BENNY
.:Guys, it's not like that.
>.There is an ugly silence. Youth #1, quite a bit taller than
>.Benny, takes a long drag of his cigarette and blows it in
..the air above Benny's head.
._YOUTH #1
>:Let's get out of here. This place
.:is all fucked, man.
._YOUTH #2
>:Ain't gonna buy no more liquor
.:here.
>.As they walk out Youth #1 makes aggressive eye contact with
..Benny. He glances back at Tony with a look of great disdain.
._YOUTH #1
.:Yeah, if you lucky.
..He stamps out his cigarette on the floor as he leaves.
._YOUTH #2
.:These fucking places, man...
>.Tony avoids looking at Benny. It's hard to tell if his look
>.is one of shame or disinterest. There is a long pause that
..Benny finally breaks by exhaling.
._BENNY
>:It's like every day I got a new
>:situation to deal with. My hand
>:feels like it's always under the
.:counter.
>.He knowingly taps the wooden stock of a shotgun under his
..counter.
._TONY
.:The kids don't stop coming.
._BENNY
>:Not recently. If it's not them it's
>:the kids they sell it to. I tell
>:you, walking home feels like I'm
>:back in Vietnam, but they're
.:needles instead of mines.
>.Tony grabs one bottle of bourbon and one of vodka, and
..brings it up to the counter.
._BENNY (CONT'D)
>:I'm so glad Victoria is away from
>:all this nonsense. She left at just
.:the right time.
._TONY
.:Anytime's the right time.
.\EXT. Benny's liquor store - day
>.Tony walks out of the store, holding a paper bag with his
>.purchases, framed by some graffiti on the wall to his right
..and a empty boot standing up in the alley to his left. 
>.A black SUV drives by with its window open. A book is tossed
>.out and hits the wall. Tony steps over and looks down at the
..pavement to see the book: "Cracking the Coding Interview."
>.Tony opens the front cover with his foot. The page is
>.covered with scrawling notes, and the owner wrote, in large
..red letters across the cover, "THIS IS BULLSHIT".
.\INT. Trendy coffee shop - day
>.Later that day, Tony enters the bright, spacious cafe full
>.of chatting young professional types, clad in tech T-shirts
..and Oxford shirts. Expensive laptops litter the tabletops.
>.Tony looks around the shop for his friend but doesn't see
>.him. He steps up to the counter manned by a female BARISTA
..in her twenties and studies it with some interest.
._Barista
.:Can I help you today, sir?
>.Tony doesn't answer but keeps looking at the menu for a
..while.
._BARISTA (CONT'D)
>:Actually, we have a special today,
>:we're offering a seasonal Mint
>:Appletini Cappuccino. We use
>:special Indonesian beans for a
>:full-bodied, kind of earthy taste,
.:and it's one of our more popular--
..Tony interrupts her.
._TONY
.:Green tea, please.
..The barista is completely unfazed.
._BARISTA
>:Always a good choice! How do you
>:like your tea, sir? [This comedy is
.:a bit hacky]
._TONY
.:In a cup.
>.From the side his friend REID MAYER approaches. Reid is
>.white, well-built, about the same age as Tony, with silver
>.temples and an avuncular look. He wears an open-neck shirt
>.and khaki blazer, looking like a king next to the casual
..younger people in the cafe.
._Reid
.:Tony, there you are.
._TONY
.:I didn't see you when I came in.
._Reid
>:I'm at a table behind that column
.:over there. 
..Reid stands back and smiles a bit.
._Reid (CONT'D)
>:Now what happened to the famous
>:Tony Kong situational awareness?
.:Total focus, if I remember right?
>.Tony gives him his first truly genuine smile, the smile of
>.old friends forged by years of camarederie and shared
..experiences.
._TONY
.:I get worse every year, Reid. 
._Reid
>:Not the first time I've told you
.:you're out of practice.
._TONY
>:Not the first time I've told you
.:it's entirely by choice.
>.Tony and Reid sit together at a table, Reid leaning back on
..the column with a large latte in hand. 
._TONY
>:I suppose I don't have to ask how
.:the business is doing.
._Reid
>:There are more of these tech types
>:pouring in every day. They all have
>:money and they all want to look
>:cooler than the next guy in the
>:office. What better way to blow it
>:than with premium martial arts
.:lessons? 
>.Tony delicately stirs a sugar cube into his tea and smiles
..sarcastically.
._TONY
>:These sound like top-notch
.:students. 
._Reid
>:Of course not. But it's a gold mine
.:nonetheless.
._TONY
>:Maybe for them. Not every ship in
>:this neighborhood is lifted by this
.:tide, Reid.
._Reid
>:Say what you will, but these people
>:are motivated. And they're willing
>:to pay extra for the best. They
>:want the expertise, the
.:uh...authenticity.
..Reid leans forward and looks at Tony seriously.
._Reid (CONT'D)
>:I know how you feel about it. But
>:there is a real place for someone
.:like you.
._TONY
.((wryly)
.:Someone with authenticity?
._Reid
>:Someone with real understanding and
>:decades of experience. Tony, I
>:could really fight in my younger
.:days, but you?
._TONY
.:I don't fight. I never did.
._Reid
>:Perform, then. Years ago I always
>:wanted you to teach me. I always
>:wanted your advice. Now you can
>:teach them, a whole new generation
.:of students.
..Tony leans back, looking away from his friend.
._TONY
>:The seasons turn and times change,
>:but I'm still gonna refuse you.
.:Same way I always have.
._Reid
>:Don't you ever think about the way
.:things were?
._TONY
>:I don't like talking about the old
.:days.
._Reid
.:Then why do you still talk to me?
..Point taken.
._TONY
>:It's a nasty business, Reid. I
>:don't want to spend more of my life
.:bringing pain into this world. 
._Reid
>:If that's really what you think,
>:I'm not sure how you get out of
.:bed.
._TONY
>:That's why I don't like talking
.:about it.
..Reid stands up, looking sadly at his onetime comrade.
._Reid
>:You don't get a lot of chances to
>:be really good at something, Tony.
>:If you ever change your mind,
>:there's always a place for you at
.:my dojo. I'll see you around.
._TONY
.:Bye, Harry.
>.Reid walks out as Tony finishes his tea. He looks around the
>.coffee shop and stares at a mural on the wall, a
>.1930s-New-Deal-style piece showing a diverse collection of
>.workers rallying together. Next to it is a picture of an
>.Asian worker (presumably from Indonesia) holding a basket of
..coffee beans.
.\Int subway car - day
>.Cramped between a diverse group of Bay Area passengers on
>.BART (a tableau similar to the mural), we meet LUCY MAO, 21,
>.a pretty college student wearing a backpack, coming back
>.home to Oakland from classes at SFSU. She's slim, not very
>.physically intimidating, but seems to have a kind of wiry
..strength. 
>.Running off a few hours of sleep at most, exhausted by her
>.day of classes and travel, she looks and feels like a
>.squeezed lemon, pushed into the corner of the train car by
..more assertive passengers.
>.She is squashed between an older woman with a walker, some
>.teenagers with headphones, and a few older, stressed-looking
>.businessmen. The train stops and some finance bros enter,
>.all talking loudly, clad in brightly-colored button-up
..shirts, with one of them bent staggering in, looking sick.
._Finance bro #1
>:Damn, Connor, at least make it onto
.:the train!
._Finance bro #2
>:I thought you were gonna puke back
.:at the fucking bar, man!
._Connor
.:Nah, I'm good.
._FINANCE BRO #1
.((laughs)
.:He's good! He's fucking good!
._FINANCE BRO #2
.:You went so hard back there.
._FINANCE BRO #1
>:Bro, I haven't seen him do Happy
>:Hour like that since St. Patrick's
.:Day!
._FINANCE BRO #2
>:Oh yeah! Now that was some real
.:shit.
>.Connor backs up into Lucy without seeing her. At the other
>.end of the train, two young PERFORMERS enter, both black,
>.one carrying a boom box and the other wearing shorts and a
..baseball cap.
._lead Performer 
>:Alright, ladies and gentlemen,
>:you're in for a special ride today!
>:My name is Andre and this is my
>:friend Craig, and we are Lake
>:Merritt's finest hip-hop dance
>:group! We'd like to put on a little
.:show for everyone here!
>.As most of the train car looks towards them with interest,
>.Backup Performer turns on some hip-hop music. Lead Performer
>.stakes out some space and begins dancing. Lucy's phone
..rings.
._Lucy
.:Hi, Donna.
._DONNA (VO)
>:When are you getting in today? Carl
>:has to end his shift early today
>:and I need someone manning the
.:store.
._LUCY
>:Oh my god, I had no idea. I'm on my
>:way back now. I had to wait in line
>:for like 45 minutes at office
.:hours.
._DONNa (V0)
>:Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, dear. I
>:know how hard you work over there.
>:But Yiming still hasn't left the
>:hospital and I need as much help as
.:I can.
..The performers' song finishes.
._lead PERFORMER 
>:Alright, folks, if you could give
>:us some donations, it would be much
>:appreciated. We work hard bringing
>:you the best dancing in the Bay
>:Area and your donations help keep
.:us going.
>.They start walking with a hat held out down the train car. A
>.few passengers throw in some coins. Lucy tries to keep
..talking over them.
._LUCY
>:I know, I know, I really hope he
>:gets well soon. I'll go straight
>:there when I get off BART, I
.:promise.
._DONNA (VO)
>:That's good, Lucy. I'll see you
.:soon.
..The performers reach Lucy as she is starting to hang up.
._lead PERFORMER
>:Hello there, pretty lady, can I get
.:a donation?
._LUCY
>:Oh, I'm sorry. I don't have any
.:change.
._lead PERFORMER
>:Come on baby, can't you give us a
>:little something? Didn't you like
.:our dance?
._LUCY
.:Uh, yeah, it was real nice...
._lead PERFORMER
.:Why don't you want to help us out?
._LUCY
>:It's not that, I just don't have
.:any change. I'm sorry.
>.The other passengers, including the finance bros next to
>.her, start to stare. Connor starts bending over slightly,
..his hands on his knees.
._backup Performer
.:You know how hard we work on this?
._lead PERFORMER
.:Why you gotta be like this?
>.Lucy's polite exterior starts to crack. She waves her phone
..a bit as she talks.
._LUCY
>:You know, even if I had change, I
>:couldn't just give it away. I have
.:to work hard for everything too.
..Lead Performer looks her body up and down.
._lead PERFORMER
.:Oh yeah, where do you work?
._backup PERFORMER
>:That's real privileged of you,
>:acting like you can't help someone
.:else out.
>.The finance bros start to laugh at this. Connor looks worse
..than ever.
._LUCY
>:Ok, I am not privileged, and that
.:has nothing to do with...
._lead PERFORMER
.:Look pretty privileged to me.
._backup PERFORMER
>:You're not the one busting your ass
.:on the subway.
._LUCY
>:I work pretty hard, alright? Can
>:you just leave me alone? There's
.:other people in the car.
._lead PERFORMER
.((sarcastic)
>:Oh sorry baby, I didn't know you
.:wanted to be left alone.
._backup PERFORMER
.:Why don't you smile a little bit?
..Lucy finally snaps and shouts.
._LUCY
>:Please just shut up and leave me
.:alone!!
>.Connor bends over and PUKES all over Lucy's shoes, with the
>.vomit splattering her legs but missing the performers in
..front of her. Finance Bro #2 roars with laughter.
._FINANCE BRO #2
.:Oh shit!
._FINANCE BRO #1
.:Connor for the win!
>.They pat his back. The Performers look disgusted and turn
>.around, leaving the train car. Lucy, still holding her
>.phone, looks down with resignation. After having a rare
>.outburst before, this was the straw that breaks the camel's
..back. She simply can't be angry anymore today.
.\Int donna's shop - day
>.Lucy trudges into Donna's grocery shop, still wearing her
>.backpack, her shoes and legs somewhat washed off but with
>.vomit stains still visible. It's a Chinese corner store with
>.bilingual signage and plenty of Asian produce. The place is
>.old but lovingly well-kept, like a cheap, decades-old Honda
>.Accord that is still going strong. The bell rings as she
..enters. 
>.Donna is in the back of the store kneeling down, putting
..items on the shelf, and stands up when she sees Lucy.
._DONNA
>:Lucy! There you are! You made good

._LUCY
>:I, uh, I came as fast as I could.
.:Can I go put my stuff down?
._DONNA
.:Oh yes, of course!
>.Lucy walks past a customer, who recoils at her smell. She
>.opens up a small closet in the back and tosses the backpack
..inside, then shuts the door.
.\INT. donna's shop - bathroom - day
>.She pulls off her shoes and starts washing them in the sink.
..She pauses to look in the mirror at her tired face.
.\INT. DOnna's shop - NIGHT
>.Lucy stands behind the counter, bored and tired. She glances
..up at the clock, which reads 1 am.
>.Two tattooed thugs in their mid-20s, WOOJIN and NICO enter
>.the shop. Nico, the taller Hispanic one, wears a white
>.tank-top, while Woojin, the shorter Korean one, wears a
>.Raiders hat and T-shirt. They are older and more
>.experienced-looking than the wannabe youths who went into
>.Benny's liquor store; actual enforcers for the infamous
..Clarence Tran.
._WOOJIN
.:We need to talk to your boss.
._LUCY
>:Uh, I'm sorry, is there something I
.:can help you with?
>.Nico turns the sign on the door to Closed, glancing out the
..window for any passersby.
._WOOJIN
.((points)
.:Is Yiming here? Is he in the back?
._LUCY
.:No, it's just Donna. I don't...
._WOOJIN
.:Thanks for the help.
>.Woojin throws some change in the tip jar. Nico and Woojin
>.simply turn and start walking slowly towards the back. Lucy
..senses the danger, but decides not to back down.
._LUCY
>:Listen, I'm sorry, but I can't let
>:you go back there. What is the
.:problem?
>.Woojin looks back at it with a slightly amused smile,
..surprised that this young woman dares to talk back to him.
._WOOJIN
.((calling out)
.:Donna! Donna!
..Donna comes running out of the back and turns white.
._DONNA
.:Oh, hello there! 
..She looks nervously at Lucy.
._DONNA (CONT'D)
>:You know I didn't expect you
.:gentlemen during store hours.
._WOOJIN
>:You know, me neither. Matter of
>:fact, I was expecting to blaze a
>:little, play some Overwatch, and
>:eat a bunch of fuckin' pretzels
>:tonight. But instead we gotta come
>:out to this shithole because your
>:shithole husband hasn't paid us in
.:a week. Where's Yiming?
._Nico
>:Mrs Hu, your husband's been sowing
>:the wind. He knew he would have to
.:reap our fury sooner or later. 
._DONNA
>:You don't understand, he's been
>:very sick! Last week
&:___________________________________

._WOOJIN
>:That's a real shame, Donna. Maybe
>:if you told Clarence about it when
>:it happened he might have given you
>:a break. He's a pretty sympathetic
.:guy. But it's too fucking late now.
._Nico
>:Three days, six hours, and twelve
.:minutes late.
._WOOJIN
.:Money's due. That's it.
._DONNA
>:Please! Can you talk to Clarence
>:and tell him! We have to deal with
>:the hospital bills too, now! We are
.:working on it, I promise!
>.Nico keeps staring straight at Donna, while Woojin takes a
..long, nostalgic look around at the store.
._WOOJIN
>:I used to go to a little store like
>:this every day when I was little.
>:Pick up some candy and a Spider-man
>:comic. The old woman who ran it was
>:real nice to me. Except when I was
>:thirteen years old, and I came in
>:smelling like weed, and she told me
>:I was a little delinquent and I
>:needed to get the hell out of her
>:store. All this in Cantonese. I
>:don't even speak fucking Cantonese.
>:Anyway, next week I snuck in and
>:took a bunch of Snickers while Jose
.:here distracted her.
>.Donna looks confused, while Nico silently nods, as if he
>.knows this story well and thinks it makes perfect sense.
..Woojin looks at Donna sympathetically.
._WOOJIN (CONT'D)
>:But somehow, I still have good
>:memories of that place. I respect
>:her now for being a hardass with
>:principles. So, I'm gonna give you
>:two days to get us the money.
.:Alright?
._DONNA
>:That will be fine! I'll talk to
.:Yiming tomorrow.
._WOOJIN
.:Good. I'm ecstatic.
._Nico
.:Like the Ecstasy of St. Teresa.
._WOOJIN
>:I think I'm gonna go home and jerk
>:off while I'm still full of this
.:loving feeling.
>.They turn away to leave. Woojin, however, steps up to the
..counter.
._WOOJIN
.:Hey, give me a pack of the Camels.
..Lucy glares at him.
._WOOJIN
>:You seem to feel pretty strongly
>:about smoking. Don't worry, I've
>:seen the videos with the fucked-up
.:black lungs and I'm ok with it.
>.Donna looks at Lucy, eager to get the two men out of her
..store.
._DONNa
.:Go on.
>.Lucy silently gets his cigarettes and continues to glare at
..him.
._LUCY
.:That'll be $6.19.
>.Woojin looks amused, and glances back at Nico, who remains
..impassive.
._Nico
>:Don't blame her for being a free
>:thinker. She hasn't been
>:brainwashed by Humphrey Bogart and
>:Jean-Paul Belmondo and Big Tobacco
.:to think smoking is cool.
..Woojin looks at Nico with disbelief, who shrugs.
._Nico
>:Read some Chomsky. You'll learn all
.:about it.
._WOOJIN
>:Smoking is cool. And it gives me
>:something to do when I don't want
>:to talk to anyone. Sorry I don't
>:spend my money on fucking lettuce
.:and smoothies.
._NICO
>:I won't apologize for the amount of
.:fiber I eat.
>.Woojin pulls out his wallet, then puts down $10. He grabs a
>.bag of M&Ms from the counter and leaves with Nico. Nico
>.glances up at the bell as he leaves, somewhat interested in
..the device.
..There is a long silence.
._LUCY
>:You didn't tell me you were paying
.:these people.
._DONNA
>:This isn't something you were
>:supposed to see. Yiming handled all
.:this.
._LUCY
.:I can't believe this!
._DONNA
>:Honey, this is what it takes to run
>:a business here. Everyone has to do
.:it. Think of it as a private tax.
._LUCY
>:Are you crazy? Clarence Tran? This
>:is really dangerous. I can't
>:believe you're in business with
.:him. I just...
._DONNA
>:You grew up here and didn't know
.:about this?
..Lucy is silent, a little ashamed.
._DONNA (CONT'D)
>:I know you spend your time at
>:school now, and things seem very
>:idealistic and in all your class
>:they talk about changing the world
>:or making the world a better place.
>:And I believe you will. But right
>:now, this is the reality we deal
.:with. There's no other way.
._LUCY
>:Has anyone ever tried to...you
.:know, take him down?
..Donna laughs.
._DONNA
>:What, take down Clarence Tran? Like
.:in the Intouchables?
._LUCY
.:The Untouchables?
._DONNA
>:Lucy, you're acting very strange.
>:You're not a little girl anymore.
>:You know about the cops around
.:here.
._LUCY
.:I didn't mean the cops.
._DONNA
>:There are no heroes around to kill
>:the dragons, either. It's not
.:wuxia.
._LUCY
>:Please don't make fun of me. I just
>:think it's ridiculous that we
>:tolerate it and no one does
>:anything. And for the record, I
>:know about Clarence Tran. I see his
>:guys on the street, I know he runs
>:everything around her. But I didn't
>:think he reached his tentacles in
>:here. [YIKES! This dialogue is
.:bad.]
._DONNA
.((beat)
>:You talk so well. It reminds me of
.:your mother. 
..Donna goes to the corner to pick up a broom.
._DONNA
>:You've had a long night. You should
.:go home, I can clean up.
>.Lucy looks dejected. She closes up the cash register,
..removes her apron, and starts to pack up.
>.She emerges from the back room, slinging on her backpack.
..Donna has stopped sweeping and looks thoughtful.
._DONNA
>:You know, it's funny what you said
.:about wuxia. 
._LUCY
.:You were the one who said wuxia.
._DONNA
>:It's just that you were talking
>:about some kind of hero. Like in a
>:wuxia movie. Someone who could
>:fight a man like Clarence Tran. I
>:know a man who lives here. And when
>:he was younger he was more like one
>:of those heroes than anyone I ever
.:met.
._LUCY
.:Who is he?
._DONNA
.((smiles)
>:Oh, he's older now. He doesn't
>:fight. Unless you tried to take
.:away his liquor, of course.
._LUCY
>:Are you talking about Mr. Kong? The
.:stories are true?
._DONNA
>:They don't come close. They
>:couldn't even make a wuxia movie
>:about him without making him a
>:wizard. No one would accept it as
.:realistic.
._LUCY
>:I though the neighborhood kids were
.:just making fun of him. 
._DONNA
>:I met someone who knew him when he
>:was a student in China. He said
>:that the police wanted to arrest
>:Tony for fighting in public. They
>:sent a squadron of cops with clubs
>:to surprise him when he was bathing
>:at a river. Tony had a towel and
>:bar of soap with him. It wasn't a
.:fair fight.
..She chuckles to herself, enjoying the legend she is weaving.
._LUCY
>:If this is true, how come my karate
>:master has never mentioned him? If
>:there was really a world-class
>:martial arts warrior living in our
>:neighborhood, I think I would have
.:heard about it.
._DONNa
>:Karate? That Japanese shit? Your
>:"master" wouldn't know a real
>:martial artist if he got his ass
>:kicked by one! Which he would, if
>:he tried to fight with karate.
>:Besides, Tony doesn't tell many
>:people about it. He's, uh...what do
.:they say? Hung up his spurs.
._LUCY
>:But it's like you said, he's
>:someone who could actually do some
>:good. Even if it does sound a
.:little crazy.
._DONNA
>:He wouldn't even like me telling
>:you this. Only a few of us
>:old-timers even know about it. He's
>:a man who likes his privacy.
>:Besides, none of these new martial
>:artists respect tradition anyway.
.:They'd probably laugh at Tony.
._LUCY
.:Why doesn't he fight anymore?
._DONNA
>:You'd have to ask him. But don't!
>:He wouldn't tell you if you did.
>:Not that you should! You should
>:keep focusing on your studies. And
>:on working here. I have to deal
>:with this business with Clarence
>:Tran now, I'll need even more of
.:your help in the store.
._LUCY
>:I'll keep helping. But caving to a
>:gangster isn't the way to deal with
>:this business. I'm going to handle
.:it myself.
._DONNA
.:Lucy!
>.She leaves in a huff, slamming the door. Donna goes back to
..sweeping.
._DONNA
.:Fucking college kids.
.\Int. karate dojo - day
>.Lucy kicks the air in front of her, one in a line of
>.students practicing. She is dressed in her karate robes, a
..green belt around her waist. 
>.In the center of the karate mat in this dojo, we see the
>.instructor, MASTER DOUGLAS, early 40s, a tall, black,
..black-belted man with a tough, wiry face and frame.
..He paces around, watching the students kick.
._MASTER DOUGLAS
>:Faster! This is about speed! It
.:doesn't need to be that high!
>.Lucy kicks the air over and over, clearly quicker and better
..than the other students.
._MASTER DOUGLAS
.:Don't leave yourself exposed!
..The other students seem to struggle. Not Lucy.
._MASTER DOUGLAS
.:That's enough!
..The students all stop, slumping.
._MASTER DOUGLAS
.: Kiotsuke! 
..Now they stand at attention.
._MASTER DOUGLAS
>:Students, I'm pleased with your
>:progress. As long as you have been
>:keeping up your fitness
>:requirements at home, you'll be
>:well placed for the belt exam next
.:Friday.
..He glances briefly at Lucy, his star pupil.
._MASTER DOUGLAS
.((suddenly shouts)
.:Got that, Kevin?
>.Kevin, a doofy looking, redheaded white college kid, starts
..suddenly.
._Kevin
>:I've been practicing every day,
.:sensei!
._MASTER DOUGLAS
>:Practicing the ___ kick is good
>:alone. But perfect technique means
>:nothing if you can't use it
>:effectively  against your opponent.
>:We're going to break out into pairs
>:to spar. I want you to focus on
.:using the ___. Understood?
._All students
.:Yes, master!
._MASTER DOUGLAS
>:Good. First I need two students to
.:demonstrate for us. Any volunteers?
>.Lucy's hand shoots up. Master Douglas smiles, seeing his
..favorite student volunteer.
._MASTER DOUGLAS
.:It has been a while, Lucy. Step up.
..He looks around. Kevin reluctantly raises his hand.
._KEVIN
.:Sensei, I'll go.
._MASTER DOUGLAS
.((smiles)
.:Good. Let's begin.
>.Lucy and Kevin face each other, then bow. Kevin is about 6
..inches taller than Lucy, but looks scared.
._KARAte Student #1
.:Come on Kevin, you got this!
._karate Student #2
.:Yeah man, let's go!
._MASTER DOUGLAS
>:Kevin. Focus and remember to
>:protect your upper body. Don't
.:allow an easy strike.
>.The two students circle as the crowd calls out. Kevin seems
>.to be willing himself into acting. Lucy simply waits,
..looking intently.
._KARATE STUDENT #1
.:Go, go!
._MASTER DOUGLAS
.:Focus, Kevin!
..There is a tense silence. Finally Kevin strikes. 
>.His move is exceptionally slow. Lucy easily dodges it and
..sends a spectacular kick right into his face. 
..He keels over instantly.
._karate STUDENT #2
.:Oh shit!
._LUCY
>:Oh my god, I'm sorry! Oh god, are
.:you okay?
>.Master Douglas steps forward. Some in the crowd laugh,
..others seem concerned.
._MASTER DOUGLAS
>:Alright everyone, calm down! Stay
.:back!
..Lucy stands over Kevin, who is moaning weakly.
._LUCY
>:Kevin, I'm really sorry! I didn't
.:mean to do that!
._MASTER DOUGLAS
.:Alright, it's ok. He's ok.
.\int. Master douglas's office - day
>.In the background, through the glass of his office windows,
>.students are seen picking up their bags and leaving the gym.
>.A group of students are gathered around Kevin, who rubs his
..face.
..A mortified Lucy follows Master Douglas into his office.
._LUCY
>:Sensei, I'm so sorry about that. I
.:just...kind of went for it.
._MASTER DOUGLAS
.((laughs)
>:Oh, Lucy, I shouldn't be laughing,
>:but I'm only human. It's alright,
>:ok? I know you're just trying to be
.:the best, and Kevin can take it.
._LUCY
>:Thank you. I'll try to tone it down
.:in the future.
._MASTER DOUGLAS
>:You don't have to tone it down, you
>:just have to consider what you're
>:doing when you're sparring versus
>:when you're competing. But that
>:drive you have, that passion is
.:good!
..He sits down behind his desk, and opens up his computer.
._LUCY
>:Master Douglas, how long have you
.:been teaching?
._Master douglas
>:Karate? Oh, I'd say...22 years. 19
.:years of judo.
._LUCY
>:So would you say you know most of
>:the martial artists and masters in
.:the Bay Area?
._MASTER DOUGLAS
.((thinks for a moment)
>:Yeah, I'd say so. Definitely in
>:East Bay. It's not the biggest
>:community, especially if you take
>:out the MMA and Brazilian jiu-jitsu
>:people. Although usually it's other
>:people recognizing me. Ain't too
>:many black guys in this line of
.:work. How come?
._LUCY
.:Have you ever heard of Tony Kong?
._MASTER DOUGLAS
>:Tony Kong? Why you asking about
.:that?
._LUCY
.:Just historical curiosity.
._MASTER DOUGLAS
>:Yeah, I've heard of him. Never met
.:him, he retired before my time.
._LUCY
.:Retired?
._MASTER DOUGLAS
>:Well, I don't know if you call it
>:retired. I've heard from some of
>:the old-timers that he quit. Left
>:and never came back, didn't want
>:anything to do with kung fu,
.:martial arts, none of it.
._LUCY
.:Why would he do that?
._MASTER DOUGLAS
>:Even the old-timers don't know.
>:Don't know or don't say. They still
>:talk about him, though. Hard for
>:any master to measure up to him. He
>:casts a shadow over all of us. Has
.:for over 30 years.
._LUCY
.:So the stories are true?
._MASTER DOUGLAS
.((smiles)
.:Historical curiosity, you said?
._LUCY
>:Yeah. I just think it's weird that
>:I've never heard of this great
.:master before. 
._MASTER DOUGLAS
>:I just wish I could have seen him.
>:Our world was robbed of a legend
>:when he left. It would be like if
>:Achilles stayed in his tent
.:forever.
.\Ext. tony's apartment - porch - dusk
>.Tony comes out of his house, wobbling a little holding a
>.beer and a tattered copy of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms."
>.The house's paint is faded, and the yard looks overgrown
>.with weeds. He looks around at the street, exhales, and
>.takes a seat on the single, dusty rocking chair on his
..porch. The neighborhood is calm.
>.He takes a swig of his beer, props open his book, and props
>.his feet up, only the tips of his shoes edging out into the
..light from the shadow under his porch.
._LUCY (OS)
.:Excuse me, Mr. Kong?
>.Lucy, changed out of her karate robes, is standing in front
..of his porch.
._TONY
.:Good morning. What's the matter?
._LUCY
>:Could I talk to you about
.:something?
..Tony shrugs, and gestures to her with his beer bottle.
._TONY
.:I don't see why not. Come up.
>.Lucy hesitantly climbs the first step, keeping a distance
..from the older man.
._TONY (CONT'D)
>:You live in this neighborhood,
>:right? You work at Yiming's store,
.:with Donna?
._LUCY
>:Yes, I do. My name's Lucy Mao. I've
>:lived here almost all my life and
>:it's funny, I don't think I've ever
.:talked to you.
._TONY
>:That's alright. Usually I try to
>:keep it that way. That's what I
>:like about Donna, you know. I've
>:known her for a long time and she
>:always respects privacy. She's not
.:the type to gossip.
._LUCY
>:She's really great. I'm lucky to be
.:working with her.
._TONY
>:And besides, not many people come
.:to talk to me, either.
._LUCY
>:I actually want to ask you
.:something.
._TONY
.:People do that even less.
._LUCY
>:You know who Clarence Tran is.
.:Don't you?
._TONY
.((frowns)
>:I don't think there's much I can
>:tell you about him. I stay out of
.:that sort of thing.
._LUCY
>:He runs everything in this
>:neighborhood. He owns the strip
>:club down the street, he
>:intimidates all the local
>:businesses, he's got all the
>:dealers and kids on the street
.:working for him.
._TONY
>:Yeah. That's how it's been for a
>:while now. You just finding this
.:out? You in college right now?
._LUCY
>:That has nothing to do with it. I'm
>:from here, I know about him. I did
>:just find out that Donna is paying
.:him protection money.
._TONY
.((takes a swig of beer)
>:Doesn't surprise me. No other way
.:for them to run the business.
._LUCY
>:You see, that's the problem. People
>:like you, they just shrug and move
>:on and don't do anything about it.
>:They tolerate it every day, and
.:they have for years.
._TONY
>:What do you mean, people like me?
>:Old people? People who've lived
.:here for decades?
._LUCY
>:People who can change things.
>:People who can fight back against
.:injustice.
>.There is an imperceptible change on his face--the look of a
>.man who already knows what she will say but who tries to
..give her nothing.
._TONY
>:I have no idea what you're talking
.:about.
..Lucy now climbs up one more step on the porch.
._LUCY
>:Mr. Kong, you know exactly what I
>:mean. I know you try to bury it,
>:but I've heard stories about you
>:for years. Stories about the guy
>:who lives down the street, the old
>:guy who drinks too much, who used
>:to be some sort of kung fu legend.
>:Growing up, I always thought the
>:other kids were making up stuff
>:because no one knew what you did or
>:where you came from. But Donna told
>:me about you. She told me about who
.:you used to be.
>.Tony sits up, all his languid calm gone. He holds the bottle
..like a weapon, his legs tensing up.
._TONY
>:Listen very carefully, Miss Lucy
>:Mao. Everything you've heard about
>:me is wrong. They're all a bunch of
>:goddamn lies. I don't know why
>:Donna would tell you something like
.:that. 
._LUCY
>:Please don't deny it. I'm not here
>:to convince you of something we
>:both know is true. I'm here because
.:I want your help. 
._TONY
>:See, that's something people never
>:want from me. Because I don't do
.:it.
._LUCY
>:Clarence Tran shouldn't be able to
>:control Chinatown with no one doing
>:anything. I want to resist it. I
.:want to act.
..Tony starts laughing heartily, taking another swig of beer.
._LUCY (CONT'D)
.:And I need your help to resist him.
>.He does a dramatic spit take, partially hitting Lucy, then
>.grins and chuckles a bit, amused with himself for doing such
..an over-the-top maneuver. 
._TONY
>:I thought I might have a problem
>:with you, Lucy. But now I know I
>:won't. What you're saying is
.:ridiculous. [Kind of weak]
._LUCY
>:I know it doesn't sound
.:very...conventional.
._TONY
.:Or well thought out.
._LUCY
>:Everyone knows you're a great
>:master! I've trained in karate for
.:years--
._TONY
.:You mean Japanese swing dancing?
._LUCY
.:I want you to train me!
..Tony leans back in his chair, pauses, and finally smiles.
._TONY
>:Thank you for making an old man
>:laugh. I haven't laughed that hard
>:sober in a while. You really
.:brought joy into my life.
>.Lucy climbs up another step to stand right on the porch. Her
..head is now above Tony's.
._LUCY
>:Mr. Kong, I'm serious. I will be
>:your student. I will train and
>:study. Together we might be able to
>:take him on, take on that whole
.:organization! 
._TONY
>:Sure, you're the Chinese Eliot
.:Ness.
>.Lucy looks exasperated that all the older people in
..Chinatown seem to love The Untouchables.
._Lucy
>:At least we could make a dent in
>:it! Get some of his soldiers off
>:the street. Protect some of the
.:businesses here.
._TONY
>:What do you think this is, Way of
>:the Dragon? You think you can fight
>:the Mob with my mystical kung fu
>:skills? That they're going to put
>:down their guns and confront you,
.:mano a mano?
._LUCY
>:Are you saying you couldn't fight
.:them and win?
._TONY
.((burps drunkenly)
>:That's a very unoriginal strategy
>:there, dear, and it won't work. I
>:don't fall for cheap ego plays,
.:even after a couple of beers.
._LUCY
>:Mr. Kong, I've heard stories about
.:your skills...
._TONY
>:And they're bullshit! Just like
>:your plan! If you've heard anything
>:about me, you probably know that I
>:don't fight, and I don't teach.
>:When you were snooping around about
>:me, putting your ear to the street,
.:did you hear anything about that?
._LUCY
>:Yes. They said you haven't fought
.:for years.
._TONY
>:Exactly! I wouldn't train you if
>:you just came here and gave me a
>:thick wad of cash for a few casual
>:lessons! Much less for some
>:pie-in-the-sky, dumbass plan to
>:take down the biggest crime boss in
>:Oakland with our magical fists of
.:fury!
._LUCY
>:You see, that's why you should help
>:me! I'm not doing this for some
>:stupid, selfish reason! This isn't
>:about me, it isn't about training,
>:it's not even about you or what you
>:used to be! It's about this
.:neighborhood. You can't not care.
._TONY
.((beat)
>:Listen, I appreciate the laugh, but
>:I'd like to get back to my book and
.:my beer. Run along now.
>.Lucy bristles a bit at the condescension, but doesn't do
>.anything. As usual, she accepts the situation despite her
>.own feelings, taking one step off the porch, now looking up
..at Tony's face.
._LUCY
>:I don't know what happened years
>:ago, or why you've shriveled into
>:this. But I know you could still
.:help me. 
._TONY
.:SAYS SOMETHINGh
..Lucy leaves. 
>.Tony leans back in his chair, in deep thought. He hasn't
..thought about this part of his life for a while.
>.He picks up the book again, examining the cover. He's in no
>.mood to read, especially about mythic heroes. He puts it
..down.
./MATCH CUT TO:
.\Int. TONY's APARTMENT - night
>.Tony puts an empty shot glass down on his table. As he pours
>.himself another stiff shot of whiskey, he seems to be
>.valiantly fighting against how pathetic he knows he truly
>.is. He lurches over to his couch and lays right on top of
..the book he was reading. 
>.He switches on the TV, switching channels past sports and
>.the local news. He settles on a Spanish telenovela. His eyes
>.seem lazy; it isn't clear if his lack of alertness is due to
>.drinking, thinking about something else, or not speaking
..Spanish.
>.Tony lilts back on the couch, trying to will himself into
>.peaceful, drunken sleep. He hears a sound outside and with
..uncommon quickness goes to the door. It has started raining.
>.He takes a look at the empty chair on the porch, then
..clutches his mouth.
..He runs to the bathroom and throws himself on the toilet.
./CUT TO:
>.A view of Tony's bedroom, an immaculately made, empty bed
>.with an empty wooden chair next to it. The sound of his
>.vomit is heard from the next room.  A shocking contrast to
>.the messiness of his apartment, and melancholy in its
>.conspicuous emptiness. Today was supposed to be a relaxed,
..more mature night, and his now organized room reflects that.
..Only Lucy's revelation sparked the descent.
.\INT. TONY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - night
>.Tony pours himself a fairly strange looking mixture of
>.tomato juice, coconut water, and iced tea from a bottle. He
>.drinks it with no small look of disgust, and walks over to
..his window.
>.He looks outside at the light rain coming down. The lights
..ringing Lake Merritt shine through the window onto his face.
>.He shuts the blinds forcefully, and they sway after being
..shut, letting moving panes of light shine onto his face.
.\Int. church - night
>.A dark church, with only a sliver of light coming from under
>.a doorway in the back. We linger on that doorway, wondering
..what terrible thing lies behind it.
>.At the front of the church, another door opens, spilling
>.light into the dark pews and pulpit. The chapel looks like
>.something out of John Woo's "The Killer." Through the
>.doorway enters ANGELO, early 40s, a bald, Italian made man
>.straight out of "The Sopranos." He shivers with fear. Woojin
..and Nico come behind him, closing the door. 
>.On the other side of the church there is a sliver of light
..coming out from under a door.
._ANGELO
.:I'm not going over there!
._WOOJIN
>:Relax, it's not like we keep the
>:bolt cutters back there. We gotta
.:go around the the back for those.
._ANGELO
>:I don't give a fuck. Just kill me
.:now.
._WOOJIN
>:Clarence just wants to talk to you.
.:Stop being so morbid.
._ANGELO
.:I'm not going. I'm not gonna move.
>.Woojin rolls his eyes and looks at Angelo, thinking for a
..second.
._WOOJIN
>:Alright, how's this. I'll make you
>:a deal. You can stay where you are
>:and you won't have to go back
>:there. But you'll also lose your
.:dick.
._ANGELO
.:What? Oh, fuck no! No!
._WOOJIN
>:These are the choices you have to
.:make.
..Nico touches Angelo sympathetically on the arm.
._Nico
>:What does it matter? You'll end up
.:dead anyway. Same destination.
._WOOJIN
>:Plus, when I'm done I can pin it to
>:the wall in the back, like a good
>:luck charm. Our own little
.:crucifix, eh?
._Nico
.((wrinkling his nose)
.:It'll probably shrivel up.
._WOOJIN
>:Hey asshole, what do you know about
>:dick-based upholstery? It'll be
.:fine.
._ANGELO
>:Ok. I'll talk to him. Just please
.:stop with all this shit.
._WOOJIN
>:You drive a hard bargain, Angelo.
.:But I accept.
>.They proceed down the aisle to the backroom office, under
..the watchful eye of the crucified Jesus.
.\Int. church - back office - night
>.Nico opens the door for Angelo, who opens his arms to greet
..the offcamera Clarence Tran.
._ANGELO
.:Listen, Clarence, I..
>.A KNIFE flies through the air and lodges itself deep into
..Angelo's thigh.
..Angelo grabs his leg and collapses.
._Angelo
.:Oh fuck!
..Woojin looks not surprised but annoyed.
._WOOJIN
>:Jesus, a little warning? You could
.:have hit me!
./CUT TO:
>.CLARENCE TRAN, early 40s, lean, hawkish, sprawling over a
>.large wooden desk wearing a light gray, open-neck suit and
..gold-rimmed glasses. He stands, revealing his height.
._Clarence tran
.:Only if I wanted to.
..He motions with his head for Nico to shut the door.
._CLARENCE TRAN (CONT'D)
>:Angelo, I remember a time when I
>:was a kid when the Mafia was like a
>:dragon. They were untouchable. All
>:the pearl-clutchers could talk
>:about was how we were ever gonna
>:get rid of them. Even out here all
>:the Asian gangs were subordinate to
>:them. I remember my father smiling
>:as some fat Italian fuck sent over
>:from Las Vegas called him a chink
.:to his face. He had to take it.
>.Clarence now stands directly over the wounded Angelo,
..glowering in his face.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:But now it's just you, isn't it? No
>:one is left to come for you. I did
>:what the cops never could. I rooted
>:your kind out of this city, and the
.:whole Bay.
._ANGELO
>:I swear it's not gonna happen
>:again. I'm gonna get out of town
.:just as fast as I can, I promise...
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:Get up!
._ANGELO
.:I fucking can't. My leg--
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:Get up now! You can fight, can't
.:you? What kind of a man are you?
..Angelo simply clutches his leg, pleading with his eyes.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:Get up now or you'll never get up
.:again.
>.Angelo weakly pushes himself up. Nico helps pull him to his
..fight, then steps aside.
._WOOJIN
.:He's got a bit of a handicap, boss.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:I want to see if their grand
.:tradition dies without a fight.
..Clarence moves into a fighting position.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:Land a blow on me, Angelo, and I'll
>:let you walk out with the keys to
.:my car. Just one blow.
>.Angelo tries to collect himself somewhat, and raises his
..fists. 
>.As soon as he does so, Clarence hits him--one chop moving
..aside his fist, and another chop to the side of his neck.
>.Angelo falls against the door, catching himself from
>.falling. He pushes himself forward, flailing wildly with his
..fists. 
>.Clarence easily dodges it, striking his arm again and giving
..a great kick to the back of his leg.
>.Angelo yelps and collapses to his knees, Clarence behind
..him. 
>.Instead of finishing him, Clarence paces around him like a
>.predator. With contempt he pushes Angelo onto his back using
..just the tips of his fingers. 
..Angelo looks straight up at the ceiling, knowing he is done.
>.Clarence smiles as if he beat a child's arcade game, and
..steps lightly over to his closet.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:What else have you got for me? Any
.:trouble making your rounds?
>.Clarence opens up the closet to reveal a classic beige
..trenchcoat hanging from a hook, and a bucket underneath it.
._WOOJIN
>:Well, after Yiming Hu didn't pick
>:up again, we went over to the shop
>:to talk to him. Turns out he's been
>:sick for a week and his wife has
.:been running it.
>.Clarence puts the trenchcoat on over his suit jacket, then
..reaches into the closet to take out two white gloves.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:I see. Well that does explain the
>:absence pretty well. That place
>:hasn't missed a payment in 15
.:years. What's he got?
._WOOJIN
>:He's been in the hospital with
.:____. 
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:What did his wife say? She's still
>:gotta pay us at some point. You let
>:one of these dinky little stores
>:slide, and your grip loosens. You
>:end up like one of these guys over
.:here.
._WOOJIN
>:I said we'd give her two days to
.:come up with it.
>.Clarence pulls out a large knife from the drawer in the
..closet.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:That's good. You made the right
.:call there.
>.Clarence picks up the bucket from the closet and carries it
..over to Angelo, the knife in the other hand.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:Nothing wrong with showing them the
.:quality of mercy now and then.
>.Clarence picks up Angelo's head by his hair, then holds his
..throat over the bucket.
._ANGELO
.:Oh, Jesus...
>.Clarence SLICES his throat open like he is slaughtering a
>.pig. Blood sprays over the bucket, some splattering onto his
>.trench coat. He holds his head over the bucket with his now
..stained white gloves, delicately letting the blood drip out.
._WOOJIN
>:You didn't have to do that
>:yourself, boss. We could have taken
>:him out back, it would have been no
.:problem.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:Angelo here is a special case. I
>:wanted him here so I could do it
.:myself.
>.Suddenly Clarence's phone starts ringing, a special romantic
..song chosen as the ringtone for his wife.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:Well, shit.
>.Clarence pulls up Angelo's body and buries his head in the
..bucket. He stands up and starts pulling off his glove.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:Come help me with this.
>.Nico gamely comes over and pulls one of the gloves off, then
..tosses it onto Angelo's head.
>.Clarence opens up his trenchcoat and pulls his phone out of
..his suit jacket.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:What is it?
.\Int. tran mansion - same time
>.Clarence Tran's wife, SYLVIA TRAN, late 30s, beautiful,
>.white but dark-haired, a formidable woman with no illusions
>.about her husband, lies on the couch in their expansive
..house wearing a cocktail dress.
._Sylvia
>:If I'm calling you that means you
.:forgot.
.\Intercut - phone conversation
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:Yeah, I know.
._SYLVIA
>:Why do you buy these tickets if
.:you're just going to miss it?
>.Nico helps pull the trenchcoat off Clarence as he keeps
..talking into the phone.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:I had to work late tonight.
._SYLVIA
>:I know this happens sometimes but
>:this was really important tonight,
>:Clarence. It's hard for me to keep
>:explaining to people why I miss
>:these events. We're not going to
>:get to meet Elon Musk or the mayor
.:for a while.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.((glances at his Rolex)
>:I'm almost done here. If I drive
>:extra fast from the office we
.:should be able to make half of it.
._SYLVIA
>:Are you dressed? Don't tell me too
.:much if you don't have to.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:Yeah, I'm ready. I can just pick
.:you up.
._SYLVIa
.:Okay. That's fine.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:See you soon.
>.Clarence puts away his phone, and starts packing up his
>.suitcase at his desk. He glances down at Angelo's body in
..the doorway.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:You two clean that up. I'll call
>:you in the morning. Do not call me
.:tonight.
._WOOJIN
>:Alright. Not like we had any plans
>:tonight. Do we have to put him in
.:the Bay?
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:No. Don't do too much to him. I
>:want them to find him. That way
>:they'll know to stay out. You can
>:improvise a bit but make sure he's
.:still recognizable after.
>.Clarence picks up his suitcase and steps over Angelo's body
..into the doorway.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:Get it all off the floor, too. I
>:don't want a spot of hemoglobin in
.:this office.
._NICO
.:Have a good time, sir.
..Clarence leaves.
.\Ext. Sfsu campus - day
>.The foggy city campus of San Francisco State bustles with
>.activity. A few quirky signs and maybe a homeless person can
>.be seen (classic San Francisco). [IS THIS REALLY WHAT SFSU
..IS LIKE?]
.\Int. University classroom - day
>.Lucy slumps back in her desk near the front of the class,
>.visibly exhausted. The classroom is somewhat cramped, a
>.political science class with about 15 to 20 students, some
..scribbling, some dozed off in the back.
>.PROFESSOR PISTER, late 50s, gray-haired, fun but a bit
>.eccentric looking, stands at the board in front of the
>.class, open books jumbled on a desk in front of him. He
>.wears a loud Hawaiian shirt--he doesn't think much of
..authority, intellectual or sartorial.
>.In the front of the class is JORDAN, 20, white, clean-cut, a
..bit too well-dressed for a college student.

.\INT. benny's LIQUOR STORE - day
>.Tony comes in and goes straight into one of the aisles.
>.Benny stands behind the counter, his back turned. He can
..still recognize Tony.
._BENNY
.:Hey there, Tony!
._TONY
.((calling from an aisle)
>:Shouldn't be here long. You still
>:got any of that Russell's Reserve
.:lying around?
._BENNY
>:Might still be a bottle in the
>:back, I'd have to check. There's
>:not exactly a great demand for it
.:in Chinatown.
._TONY
.:Take your time.
>.Lucy storms into the liquor store, slamming the door open.
>.She steps forward, then thinks, turns back, and shuts the
>.door, looking at the Open sign. Unfortunately, it is neon,
..and she can't turn it to Closed. 
._LUCY
.:Mr. Kong! Mr. Kong!
._BENNY
>:What are you doing? Don't you work
.:at Yiming's store?
._LUCY
>:I know you're here, Mr. Kong, I saw
.:you go in!
>.Lucy walks past an aisle and then sees Tony, his hand on one
..of the bottles.
._TONY
>:Lucy, what are you doing here? This
.:is a public place.
._LUCY
>:You want to be a coward? That's
.:alright. I'm not going to be.
._BENNY (OS)
.:Is something going on over there?
._TONY
>:I told you I won't help you. Do we
.:have to hear me go over it again?
._LUCY
.((holds up liquor bottle)
>:I've heard your reasons. But this
>:is the real reason. I don't know
>:what you were like before you
>:discovered this. But I know what
.:you're like now.
..Lucy throws the bottle on the ground.
._LUCY
.:It's pathetic. You're pathetic.
._BENNY
.:Hey there!
..Benny tries to come around from the counter.
._TONY
.:Benny, stay back there!
>.Benny, cowed, returns to the counter, looking nervously out
..the window.
._TONY
>:You can't provoke me, Lucy. I've
>:changed. I can see what you're
.:doing.
._LUCY
>:How have you changed? Do you bring
>:a bottle around in case you feel a
.:real emotion?
..Lucy knocks over another bottle from the shelf.
._LUCY
>:I don't even know if you can fight
>:anymore. It's 4 pm, you're probably
.:buzzed by now.
._TONY
.:Stop what you're doing, Lucy.
>.Lucy kicks a bit of broken glass towards Tony. The old
..intense look comes back to Tony.
._TONY
.:You're making a mistake.
._LUCY
.:You have nothing left.
..She picks up another bottle.
._LUCY
.:A drunk old man. Pitiful.
..She throws it straight at him. 
>.Tony spins and KICKS the bottle, exploding it into a shower
>.of liquor and glass shards in mid air. We feel the dazzling
..impact.
>.Lucy seems pleased and surprised. She quickly grabs another,
..throwing it harder at his face.
..But Tony grabs another bottle from the shelf and throws it--
..The two bottles smash together in mid air.
>.Benny cannot believe what he is seeing. He goes to the door
..and hurriedly locks it.
>.Lucy is unbelievable pumped now. She grabs a bottle with
..each hand and charges toward Tony.
>.Tony dodges one blow and hits her hand, making her drop the
..bottle.
>.She kicks, but he blocks it, kicking her leg back into the
..shelf, smashing some whiskey. 
..A bottle teeters on top of the shelf, then falls onto Lucy. 
>.She dodges and swings into the middle of the aisle, then
..swings the other liquor bottle at Tony.
>.He kicks high and smashes the bottle with it still in her
>.hand. She doesn't seem injured; this is pure, delirious
>.style. Slow motion lets us appreciate the flying shards and
..globules of liquor.
>.She stabs toward him with the broken nub of the bottle, but
>.he dodges. Tony is surprised by her ferocity; it wasn't
..something he expected from someone like her.
>.Tony pulls her arm and throws her into the shelf on the
..other side of the aisle.
>.Lucy looks stunned for a minute. Another bottle threatens to
..fall onto her head.
>.Quick as a cat, Tony lunges toward her, blocks a possible
>.blow with one hand, and catches the falling bottle above her
..head with the other.
..Tony steps back with the bottle and glances at the label.
._TONY
.:He did have Russell's Reserve!
._LUCY
.:Let go of it!
>.Lucy grabs a bottle behind her and hits Tony on the side
..with it, not acknowledging his previous kindness.
>.Tony grabs the bottle between his elbow and knee, then
>.smoothly tosses it aside in a fluid motion, somehow SMASHING
..the one bottle left on the shelf behind him.
._TONY
.:You are very ungrateful.
._LUCY
.:Is that how you fight?
>.Lucy attacks, with Tony blocking her blows rather easily
..with one bottle still in his hand.
._TONY
.((glancing at bottle)
.:This is priceless!
>.Tony kicks her; this one has more force, less playfulness.
..He wants this over.
>.Lucy slams into the shelf; with no bottles left, it falls
..over.
._TONY
>:You're outmatched. I don't want to
.:hurt you.
._LUCY
.:Then teach me! I want to learn!
>.Lucy attacks again, with Tony responding, more quickly now.
..His old grace is returning. 
>.Lucy manages to kick the bottle out of Tony's hand--she
..seems to be learning from the maestro.
._LUCY
.:Are you a master, Tony?
>.Her confidence flying high, she tries the ___ kick. Her
..signature. 
>.But she slips on the liquor now splattered on the ground,
..falling right on her back. 
..Back down to earth.
>.Tony stands over her, looming. Lucy pants for a second,
..chastened.
._TONY
>:You fight with passion, Lucy. But
>:it's not enough. You need a
.:teacher.
..Lucy smiles. Tony gives her his hand and helps her up.
._TONY
.:I will be your master.
..One last bottle falls offscreen, SHATTERING loudly.
>.Benny, cowering behind the counter before, peers up and
..looks around.
._BENNY
.:What have you done to my store?
>.Tony looks around the store; we see glass shards and liquor
..everywhere; half the place is trashed.
._TONY
>:You can't trust college students
.:around alcohol, Benny.
.\Ext. Oakland docks - day
>.Sunrise. Tony drives up to an abandoned area in the Oakland
>.docks by some train tracks, with shipping containers ringing
>.it like an arena. Light is just peeking over the Berkeley
..Hills to the east. 
>.Lucy is already there, waiting impatiently, dressed in her
..karate robes.
._LUCY
.:You did say 5, right?
._TONY
.:I did.
._LUCY
.:So it's 6.
._TONY
>:If you think you're going to
>:impress me with your dedication by
.:arriving early, you won't.
._LUCY
>:I didn't come early, I came on
.:time.
._TONY
>:Well, with enough practice and
>:dedication, maybe one day you can
.:show up late too.
._LUCY
.:I don't view this as a joke.
._TONY
>:Who's the master here? Come on,
.:let's get started.
>.Tony grabs a mat out of the back of his car and starts
..carrying it towards the middle of their makeshift arena.
._LUCY
.:Why did we come here, by the way?
._TONY
>:This place is usually pretty quiet.
>:And I know the foreman around here,
>:and his kid. They said we shouldn't
.:be disturbed.
._LUCY
.:So it's not some sort of statement?
._TONY
.((smiles)
.:No. I don't play mind games.
..Tony finds a suitable spot, then lays the mat onto it.
._TONY
>:By the way, those robes are
>:ridiculous. Don't wear them next
.:time.
._LUCY
>:These are my karate robes. Master
.:Douglas says--
._TONY
>:A bunch of pseudo-philophical
>:bullshit. You're not going for
>:formal competitions anymore. You
>:want to fight people on the street?
>:You won't be wearing robes when you
>:do. Next time, wear some athletic
.:clothes.
>.Tony removes his brown leather jacket, laying it on the
..ground.
._LUCY
>:I was going to say it helps us get
.:into the right mindset.
._TONY
>:You should always be in the right
>:mindset. You'll have fractions of a
.:second to get ready for a fight.
._LUCY
.:Yes, master. I understand.
..Tony looks at her for a beat.
._TONY
>:I can see that you're a green belt,
>:though. A little higher than I
>:would have expected from your
>:performance in Benny's store. But
>:the good news is that you know the
>:basics. I don't have to make you
>:wax my car for a few days to get
>:you to understand striking. The bad
>:news is that the basics you've
>:learned will work against you if
>:you fight me or anyone else on the
.:street.
._LUCY
.:Anyone else?
._TONY
>:You're too predictable to fight
>:anyone with real knowledge, and too
>:inexperienced to take on a man
>:twice your size, even if he has no
>:training. And the ones with no
>:training can be even more
.:dangerous. They're unpredictable.
>.Tony suddenly attacks her. Lucy weakly parries, taken aback,
..but Tony throws her onto the mat.
._TONY
>:You're a psychologist now, Lucy. A
>:profiler. You have to recognize who
>:you're fighting and how they're
>:feeling. How and when they'll
.:strike. This is poker with fists.
..Lucy jumps up, and fights Tony. Again he bests her.
._TONY
>:You must train harder than you've
>:ever thought possible. You cannot
>:simply be good, you must be
>:perfect. Flawless. One misstep
.:leads to death.
..Tony kicks out her leg.
._TONY
>:Do you think you can keep living
>:your life? You can commit entirely
>:or quit now. You can't be
>:well-rounded now.  This isn't a
>:college application. Total focus is
.:required. 
..Tony attacks briefly, Lucy growing more exhausted.
._TONY
>:There is but one path to your goal
>:of greatness, and that is the path
>:of commitment and suffering. If you
>:think there is an easy way you are
>:no different from the fat Americans
>:who try to lose 100 pounds on a
.:2-week fad diet. Are you committed?
._LUCY
.:Yes!
._TONY
>:Will you forget all the tricks you
>:learned from your karate teacher?
.:All the high kicks and twirls?
..He kicks her low, right in the legs. Lucy stays down.
._LUCY
>:Yes! But is this all it's going to
.:be? You hitting me?
._TONY
.:What happened to commitment?
._LUCY
>:I'm committed to improving. But if
>:you're just beating me I don't know
.:how I can improve.
..Tony looks disapproving.
._TONY
>:All right. You want to mix it up?
>:Meet me here tomorrow morning.
.:Bring a swimsuit and goggles.
._LUCY
.:Here? By the docks?
._Tony 
.:Actually, by the marina.
.\EXT. OAKLAND marina - DAY
>.Lucy wears a one-piece swim suit, holding goggles and a cap
>.in one hand. She stares out at the water, sunlight glinting
..off the waves.
..Tony appears, walking off a small dock.
._TONY 
.:Good to see you here! 
._LUCY
.:Where did you come from?
._TONY 
.:From over there. That boat.
..He points to a small sailboat at the end of the dock.
._LUCY
.:You have a sailboat?
._TONY 
>:What did you think I do all day?
.:Drink?
._LUCY
>:Most of the time, yeah. Isn't
>:sailing while intoxicated still a
.:DUI?
._TONY 
.:Come along, down the dock.
..They start down the dock and approach the boat.
._LUCY
>:So we're sailing? That's not
>:exactly what I meant when I said I
.:wanted some variety.
._TONY 
.((smiles)
>:Oh no. I'm sailing--you're
.:swimming.
..Lucy looks out at the water, a bit horrified.
._LUCY
.:Not in the Bay!
._TONY 
>:Not in the air, and not on land! So
.:it must be in the Bay!
._LUCY
>:I don't have a wetsuit. It's got to
.:be--
._TONY 
>:Very cold. It's the same water that
>:drowned many an Alcatraz escapee.
>:Don't worry, I won't let that
.:happen.
..Tony climbs into the boat.
._TONY (CONT'D)
>:I'll sail alongside you. You swim
>:out as far as you can. When you get
>:tired I'll pick you up in the boat.
>:You can rest and warm up and go out
.:in the water.
._LUCY
.:Until what?
._TONY 
.:How long do you have?
..Lucy looks out nervously at the waves.
._TONY 
.:Get your cap and goggles on. 
>.Lucy complies reluctantly. Tony steps out onto the boat and
..gets it set up to start.
._TONY (CONT'D)
>:I'll set out first, and then you
.:dive in.
./CUT TO:
>.Tony is a few meters out, the wind pulling him further and
>.further from the dock. Lucy stands, not quite ready. Tony
..calls out to her.
._TONY 
.:You'd better go now!
..Lucy breathes very deeply.
._LUCY
.:The things I do for...oh, dammit!
..She dives in. 
>.Her entire body shivers underwater. The cold is like an icy
>.grip. She can barely breathe. The sun seems so far away. So
..does Tony's boat.
>.On the boat, Tony cracks open a cold one, and pulls out his
>.copy of Romance of the Three Kingdoms. He glances over at
..Lucy. He turns to page 48.
./CUT TO:
>.Tony, now on page 55, looks up at Lucy. She's fading
>.quickly. He puts down the book (but not the beer) and
..directs toward her.
>.In the water, Lucy sees this. She stops paddling and starts
..treading water, breathing very heavily.
>.Tony's boat glides up to her. Lucy paddles over and grabs
..the side, pulling herself out of the water.
..Tony steps over to her as she shivers.
._TONY 
.:How do you feel?
._LUCY
.:I'm...so cold...
._TONY 
.:Ready to fight?
>.Lucy looks up an instant before Tony pushes her into the
..water.
..She bobs up, indignant.
._LUCY
.:What the hell was that?
._TONY 
>:You want to get on the boat? Get
.:past me.
._LUCY
>:I thought you didn't play mind
.:games!
..Tony shrugs and takes a sip of beer.
._TONY 
>:You didn't seem to like that. I'm
.:responsive to my students.
..He puts down the beer now.
._TONY (CONT'D)
>:That water looks cold. If I were
>:you, I'd get out of it as soon as
.:possible.
>.Lucy paddles over again, disgusted. Tony lets her get on the
..boat and plant herself.
>.Tony attacks with a low jab. Lucy parries but can barely
>.stand, and with a second blow is pushed into the water
..again.
._TONY 
>:That jab I just used is a potent
>:weapon. It doesn't expose you and
>:it can open your opponent up for a
>:follow-up. Like a jab in boxing.
.:Learn it and master it.
>.Lucy is weak now. She paddles up, but stops at the side of
..the boat, panting and shivering.
._TONY 
>:You can't stay on the threshold.
>:Get in the water or get on the
.:boat.
>.Lucy pulls herself very slowly up. She stands slowly, facing
..Tony.
>.He attacks, and she shivers so violently that she falls into
..the water herself.
..She stops paddling. She slips under the surface.
..Lucy can see the sun above the waves. Down she slips.
..Until she sees a life preserver thrown onto the water.
..She paddles up and grabs it. Tony reels her in. 
>.He deposits her on the boat, shivering. He hands her a
..Thermos and a blanket.
._TONY 
>:Don't worry. It's hot chocolate.
.:Donna said you like it.
..Lucy gulps it down greedily.
._TONY 
.:She also said you like swimming.
._LUCY
>:Oh, really? This is supposed to be
.:for me? Right up my alley?
._TONY 
>:In a way. If you wish to take on a
>:man like Clarence Tran there is no

.\Montage - lucy trains while clarence tran's empire grows
>.In short: Lucy stalls while Clarence's reach grows. Every
>.day she fails in training, she fails to prevent another
>.crime, another atrocity. The stagnation of good contrasted
..with the progress of evil.
>.--Lucy quits her karate dojo, handing her robes to a
..saddened Master Douglas.
>.--Lucy trains in the gym. She seems to make progress over
..time.
>.--This progress stalls in her sessions with Tony. She never
>.seems to improve; Tony is always too quick for her. He
>.defeats her on the land and at sea. Over and over she falls
..into the water.
>.--Lucy drifts off in class, sometimes showing up with
..bruises.
>.--Meanwhile, Woojin and Nico deliver money to Clarence
..Tran's office in the church.
>.--Drugs change hands on the street; Clarence's influence
..spreads.
>.--Woojin and Nico arrive at Donna's store, with her handing
..them more money.
>.--Lucy falls short in her lessons yet again. Tony is
..disappointed.
>.--Clarence and Sylvia arrive at another event, surrounded by
>.the movers and shakers of the Bay Area. They blend right in,
>.although Sylvia seems to enjoy Clarence's influence far more
..than his company.
>.--Lucy gets out of the water, hungry, ready to fight. She
..gives Tony a good go but ends up, as always, in the water.

.\EXT. OAKLAND DOCKS - day
>.Lucy lies on her back on the mat, totally exhausted. Tony
>.stands over her, the sun visibly setting behind the Golden
..Gate Bridge.
._LUCY
>:I just...I just don't know. I feel
.:like nothing has changed.
._TONY
>:You have been making progress,
>:Lucy. You've been training hard. I
>:can see it before you even step on
.:the mat.
._LUCY
>:I don't feel it. Honestly, I've
.:probably gotten worse.
._TONY
>:This is trench warfare. You can
>:fight for months and move a few
.:inches.
._LUCY
>:Great. Chlorine gas and a
>:mud-filled trench actually sound
.:wonderful right now. 
>.Tony turns around and puts on his leather jacket, not
..answering.
._TONY
>:I warned you this would be
.:difficult. 
._LUCY
>:You're making it difficult. Maybe
>:that's what you wanted all along.
>:Wearing me away. Showing me I was
.:wrong.
._TONY
>:I am making it difficult. You can
>:either suffer in here or die out
>:there. You can't avoid it. I am
>:trying to wear you away until the
.:strongest part remains.
._LUCY
>:Well, you've succeeded. There's
.:nothing left.
..Tony pauses for a while.
._TONY
.:You want to get some dinner, Lucy?
._LUCY
.:What?
._TONY
.:Are you hungry?
._LUCY
>:I'm starving. I had class all day
.:and couldn't get lunch.
._TONY
.:Get up then.
._LUCY
>:Great. Is this the part where I
>:live for three days on cold rice
.:and a dead rat?
.\Int. Fancy restaurant - night
>.Lucy and Tony walk into a bustling restaurant, Lucy still
..looking exhausted but now quite surprised.
._LUCY
>:Wow, this is amazing. Tony, you
.:don't have to do this.
._TONY
>:I know I'm not always the most
>:encouraging. But I can't keep
>:driving you forever. You deserve
.:something after all your work. 
..A HOSTESS steps up to greet them.
._HOSTESS
.:How can I help you, sir?
._TONY
.:Table for two, please.
._HOSTESS
.:Right this way.
>.They follow the HOSTESS past laughing, suited couples and
>.groups of trendy people drinking wine--a beautiful Bay Area
>.world unknown to people like Lucy. Maybe it unfolds in one
..shot, like the Copacabana sequence from "Goodfellas."
._LUCY
>:This is so fancy. I don't think
>:I've ever eaten in one of these
.:kind of places.
._TONY
>:This place wasn't so fancy in the
>:80s. It was pretty small. And you
>:couldn't pay people to live in this
.:neighborhood.
..They sit down at their table.
._TONY (CONT'D)
>:But a lot has changed in this city
.:since then.
._LUCY
.:In parts of this city, at least.
..A WAITRESS comes up to help them with a carafe of water.
._Waitress
>:Hello, and welcome to Carollo
>:Ristorante. I will be helping you
>:this evening. Could I start you off
>:with some drinks? Perhaps your
>:daughter would be interested in
.:some wine?
._TONY
.((beat)
.:Just water for now.
._WAITRESS
>:Alright. Let me know if you have
>:any questions about the menu. The
>:special today is a spaghetti alla
>:chitarra with Chino Farm corn,
>:summer chanterelles, haricots
.:verts, and fennel breadcrumbs.
..Lucy looks confused and intrigued by the dish.
._TONY
.:That sounds delicious.
._WAITRESS
>:Okay then, I'll give you some time
>:to look over the menu and be back
.:soon.
..She smiles and leaves.
._LUCY
>:Aren't haricots verts just green
.:beans?
._TONY
.:I think so.
._LUCY
>:Why does an Italian restaurant need
.:to put their vegetables in French?
._TONY
.:I have no idea.
._LUCy
>:Is it bad that I just want some
.:ramen?
._TONY
>:You're a philistine! You need to
.:learn to appreciate nice stuff. 
._LUCY
>:I'm really hungry! Falling on my
>:butt for two hours makes me really
.:hungry.
._TONY
.((beat)
>:You know, when I first came to this
>:country, I didn't know anything
>:about American food or how they ate
.:here.
..TELLS STORY--------------------
..
._LUCY
.:Wow, I didn't know you laughed!
._TONY
>:Not in a long time. That muscle is
.:a little weak.
>.As he laughs, he looks around the restaurant and sees
>.Clarence Tran and Sylvia sit down at another table. He stops
..laughing and looks down, troubled.
._LUCY
.:What's the matter?
..Tony takes a loud sip of his water.
._TONY
.:I remembered I don't like laughing.
>.Lucy looks behind her, in time to see the portly Italian
>.owner of the restaurant, PAULY CAROLLO, standing and talking
>.with Sylvia, with three different waiters getting his table
..prepared.
._LUCY
>:Wait a second...that isn't...oh my
>:god! I recognize him from my
>:research! That's him, that's
.:Clarence Tran. He's right there.
._TONY
.:Let's just eat our meal, shall we?
._LUCY
>:Sorry, I'm not gonna enjoy my
>:haricots verts while the man I'm
>:training to fight sits right there!
>:He's right there, unarmed! I could
>:shiv him with my steak knife if I
.:wanted to!
._TONY
>:Lower your voice! He's not unarmed,
>:not here. He owns this place. He's
>:got bodyguards around here. I see
>:him come here all the time and no
.:one ever tries to do anything.
._LUCY
.:You see him come here all the time?
._TONY
>:Do you want him to recommend
.:something on the menu?
._Lucy
.: Why didn't you tell me?
._TONY
>:Why should I? The problem isn't
>:finding him. The problem is getting
>:him alone without setting yourself
.:up for a firing squad.
._LUCY
>:At least that's not hard. He's like
>:a local luminary. When I looked him
>:up I saw him in pictures for
>:charity events, basketball games,
>:galas. All places where he can't
>:bring his normal armory. But there
>:he's got the protection of the cops
>:and his rich friends. They'd rather
>:welcome a wealthy thief than anyone
.:with integrity.
._TONY
>:Lucy, you seem a bit young to be
>:speaking like this. You really
>:should leave the cynicism to us old
.:folks.
._LUCY
>:It's not a college affectation, if
.:that's what you're thinking. 
._TONY
.:I didn't say that.
..Lucy leans back in her chair and looks at Tony coldly.
._LUCY
>:One time when I was a little girl,
>:I snuck into the Westin by Union
>:Square. I was alone. I wore this
>:little patched up dress. Walked
>:behind some family's luggage, came
>:through the lobby as quickly as I
>:could. I just wanted to ride the
>:glass elevators. I'd never seen one
>:before. I rode it to the highest
>:floor I could, where I could look
>:through the glass at the whole
>:city. All the skyscrapers in San
>:Francisco. I saw the sunlight on
>:the water, the white boats that
>:looked like toys. Then I looked
>:across the water and saw the little
>:twinkling lights with the hills
.:behind them. 
>.Lucy pauses, lost in the memories of that day, looking
..through the eyes of a little girl again.
._LUCY (CONT'D)
>:I had my face glued to the window
>:when I heard a voice, very
>:distinguished. It was this old
>:woman. She said, "What do you think
>:you're doing? You shouldn't be
>:here!" She had a big hat and a
>:little dog. I think she thought she
>:was doing me a favor. Being there
>:alone. She could tell I was alone,
>:that I wasn't a guest. The security
>:guard looked guilty, but he still
.:threw me out.
.((beat)
>:I've never been back. Maybe now
>:they'd let me in. I can fake it. I
>:can put on a mask and hide among
>:them. They'll smile at you as long
>:as you talk like them. Make them
>:feel comfortable. Might even be
>:kind to you, if they're feeling
>:generous. But it's an act. You
>:never really own anything. You're
>:just renting. They can evict you
.:whenever they want.
>.Lucy sits forward in her chair, and eyes Clarence with
..hatred.
._LUCY (CONT'D)
>:He's probably stayed there many
>:times. But I doubt he's ever looked
.:out the window.
>.We follow Lucy's gaze and fix upon Sylvia, talking with
..Pauly Carollo while Clarence silently sips his water.
._PAULY CAROLLO
>:Well, Sylvia, for anyone else I
>:don't know if I would consider it,
.:but for you, I'm willing.
._SYLVIA
>:It's a very good cause, and it'll
>:bring a lot of publicity to your
.:restaurant.
._PAULY CAROLLO
>:It'll be a lot of work for us, but
.:we'll be happy to do it.
._SYLVIA
>:Don't worry about that, Pauly.
>:Clarence is willing to help with
>:the organization. He really cares
.:about this cause.
._PAULY CAROLLO
.:Is that right, Clarence?
..Clarence looks up from his water.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:That's right.
._SYLVIA
>:We can provide some substantial
>:assistance. I've planned these sort
.:of things before.
._PAULY CAROLLO
>:Well, then, I think this will turn
.:out great.
._SYLVIA
>:That's excellent. I'll get in touch
>:with you tomorrow and get you some
.:more details.
._PAULY CAROLLO
.:I'll be honored. Thanks, Sylvia.
..Pauly starts to leave, and then pauses.
._PAULY CAROLLO
.:Thanks for the help, Clarence.
..Clarence is silent. Pauly walks away a bit too quickly.
..The two sit at the table in silence for a second.
._SYLVIA
>:Why can't you show a little
.:enthusiasm?
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:I don't like him.
._SYLVIA
>:Then why are we always eating here?
>:Why don't we ever go to one of the
.:nice restaurants in San Francisco?
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:San Francisco? I hate that fucking
>:city. It's always cold. Even in the
>:summer it's always cold. Dead men
.:feel cold.
._SYLVIA
.:A funny comparison to make.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:Is it? Something the matter? Should
>:I be worried you're going to run
>:off with a tech executive? Or a
>:corporate lawyer? Or a fat Italian
.:restaurant owner? 
._SYLVIA
.:You shouldn't be.
..Clarence smiles coldly and pours them some wine.
._SYLVIA (CONT'D)
.:Besides, I like men of character. 
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:All those people at the parties you
>:drag me to. They're all hypocrites
>:anyway. If I have to hear one more
>:weak-chinned twig in a fleece vest
>:talk about making the world a
.:better place...
._SYLVIA
>:I think a lot of them have
>:interesting stuff to say. They just
>:tend to be self-important. I'm not
>:saying they're better than you,
>:Clarence, but you're not better
>:than them either. No matter how
.:much you rationalize.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:I don't rationalize. That's why I'm
.:better. 
>.He sucks up the wine in his glass like a hose. Icy as
..always.
._CLARENCE TRAN (CONT'D)
>:And it seems like every weekend,
>:when I should be out there running
>:the business with my guys, I have
>:to go to another cocktail party. I
.:wear the suit more than my gloves.
._SYLVIA
>:You can keep complaining but that's
>:the bargain. Besides, you meet some
>:important people at those events.
>:I've probably helped your business
>:more than Woojin or any one of your
.:"boys" ever did. 
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
..Sylvia leans in, quiet but insistent.
._SYLVIA
>:I don't think you should be out
>:there with them much anyway. Why do
>:you have to risk yourself on the
>:street? At this point there's so
>:many better ways to make money. I
>:had brunch with Gene the other
.:day...
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:This isn't your area, Sylvia. Don't
>:tell me how to run it. I've always
.:supported us. Always. Without fail.
>.Sylvia rolls her eyes very slightly; she's heard this one
..before.
._CLARENCE TRAN (CONT'D)
>:When have you had to worry about
>:comparing yourself to other people?
>:When have I ever said no? Just this
.:one time.
>.Sylvia doesn't take this personally. She appreciates her
..husband--even if what they share isn't really love.
._SYLVIA
.((smiles)
>:Oh, I know better than to do that.
>:Just giving you something to think
.:about.
>.She refills Clarence's glass, almost like a mother helping
..her child. She raises her own.
._SYLVIA
.:To another successful year?
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:To success.
..They clink glasses.
.\Ext. Chinatown street - night
>.Lucy walks quickly through the menacing Oakland streets,
>.clutching her cheap purse and a bouquet of flowers tightly.
>.Recent rain makes the streets shine slickly. Oakland looks
..like Gotham, or something out of a noir flick. 
.\EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
..Lucy approaches a rundown hospital.
..Lucy pushes open the front door--
.\Int. Hospital room - continuous
>.and opens the door to a hospital room hesitantly. Inside is
>.Donna, sitting by the bedside of her husband YIMING HU, 61,
>.white-haired and feeble-looking, watching an old sitcom on
>.the TV with his hand wrapped around Donna's. Yiming is more
>.heavily-accented, quieter, and less savvy--less hip,
..perhaps--than his younger wife.
._DONNA
.:Oh, hello Lucy!
._LUCY
.:Hi Donna!
._Yiming
>:Lucy? Why, it's good to see you!
.:And those flowers!
._LUCY
>:Yeah, I hope you like them. How are
.:you feeling?
._YIMING
>:Oh, you know, the same as always.
.:Day in, day out. 
._DONNA
>:The doctors say he still needs more
>:treatment, though. Won't be out of
>:the hospital for at least another
.:week.
._LUCY
.:Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that.
._YIMING
>:I'm fine, you know. Donna runs the
>:store and I get to stay in bed and
>:watch TV Land all day. And the
>:nurses take care of me when I have
>:to go to the bathroom! I don't even
.:have to get it.
..Donna rolls her eyes.
._DONNA
>:He won't stop talking about the
.:catheter. It's incessant with him.
._YIMING
>:I have always had a very small
>:bladder! Whenever there's a long
>:car ride or movie I have to worry
>:about it! When do I have to go? How
>:can I find a bathroom? Do we have
.:to pull over?  Here, I don't.
._DONNA
.:He wants to bring it home.
._YIMING
.:Well, not really...I just--
>.Lucy interrupts before the old-couple-type squabble gets too
..graphic.
._LUCY
>:I hope you get out soon. It'll be a
>:lot easier to run the store with
.:you around.
._YIMING
>:Soon, soon. Donna says you are
.:doing an excellent job helping her.
._LUCY
.:Well, not with everything.
._YIMING
.:What do you mean?
>.Donna stares at Lucy quizzically. Doesn't want her to bring
..this up.
._LUCY
>:I saw those two enforcer guys. The
.:ones who collect for Clarence Tran.
..Yiming doesn't seem fazed.
._YIMING
>:Thank you for helping with that.
>:Without your extra time I could
>:have never made the last payment.
>:We're lucky Clarence gave us extra
.:time.
._LUCY
.:Are you serious? Lucky?
._Donna
>:Better than what happened to
>:Wan-Min! That store didn't burn
.:down due to a gas leak.
._YIMING
>:She's right! She knows these
.:things.
._LUCY
>:I just really think it's wrong that
>:you have to pay out to operate a
>:business. Someone should really do
.:something.
._YIMING
>:Someone? No. Not the police. I'm
>:more scared of them than Clarence.
>:You know when you're in trouble
.:with him.
._LUCY
.:Someone else.
..Yiming shrugs.
._YIMING
>:You are very young, Lucy. I'm a
>:poor, sick old man. I'm not trying
>:to cause any trouble. It's not
>:worth it. When I was twenty-one
>:years old I saw a college professor
>:thrown out of his home by the Red
>:Guard. And when he tried to fight
>:back they beat him and broke his
>:glasses. And they shot him too. I
>:didn't do anything like that, I
>:just got out of there. I'm happy to
>:be here with a nice bed and a TV.
>:Pretty soon I'll be in hell...or
.:heaven. [Bad Engrish joke?]
>.As he says hell he points up, and points down when he says
..heaven.
._YIMING (CONT'D)
.:I won't have to worry about it.
._DONNA
>:You should get some sleep. Thank
.:you for the flowers, Lucy.
..A nurse enters behind Lucy.
._NURSE
>:Alright, Mr. Hu, let's check that
.:IV.
>.She muscles Lucy out of the way. She puts the flowers down
..on the table. Smiles hollowly.
._LUCY
.:Get well soon.
.\EXT. OAKLAND marina - day
>.Another session. Sunset, Lucy standing at the pier. It feels
>.like it will never end for Lucy. But today, with her hair
>.bundled up with a chopstick thrown in for good measure, she
..is tired of failing.
>.She pulls out the chopstick and looks out at the Bay. But
..not straight ahead, where Tony is manning his sails.
>.She looks along the coast, spying a rocky outcropping south
..of the marina.
._TONY
.:Let's go, Lucy!
..She doesn't put the cap on.
..She dives in, heading right along the coast.
>.Tony seems surprised, as she swims away from him, rather
..than beside him. But he tacks his sails and follows her.
.\Ext. rocky outcropping - continuous
>.Tony sails along the coast with suspicion. Lucy swims by the
>.rocks, then carefully climbs onto a rock, out of the water,
..the one furthest from the coast.
._TONY
.:Be careful, Lucy!
..Lucy wrings out her hair.
._LUCY
.:Come closer!
..Tony sails right up to the rock Lucy is standing on.
._TONY
>:I can't get any closer to these
.:rocks!
._LUCY
.:I know.
>.Before Tony can register, Lucy jumps off the rock onto the
..deck of the boat.
..She attacks immediately.
..Tony parries, but it's a fair fight now.
>.Lucy attacks. Tony deflects, but she is holding herself
..well.
..Tony lands a blow, KNOCKING her back onto his cooler.
..She looks down, grabs the Thermos, and tosses it at him.
>.Tony deflects it, but Lucy suddenly attacks with a jab. The
..jab Tony taught her.
..She jabs again. Tony is opened up.
..She goes for the __ kick, just like in judo.
..It lands.
..Tony falls flat on his back.
..Lucy, for once, towers over him.
>.He looks at her, panting. The slightest of smiles crosses
..his lips.
._TONY
.:Now that...is what I want.
>.They both know the significance. Tony gets up, calm. Lucy is
..still at the ready.
._TONY
>:There's no need, Lucy. That's the
.:end of today's lesson.
..Lucy doesn't lower her fists.
._TONY
.:You want to get a drink?
>.Lucy looks more surprised by this than by her success. She
..lowers her fists.
._LUCY
.:A drink? Like, a drink?
._TONY
>:Yeah. You are old enough to go to a
.:bar, right?
._LUCY
.:I mean, yeah, but...
._TONY
.:Then let's go.
>.Lucy looks awkward. Tony turns to leave, but then stops,
..seeing her expression.
._TONY
.:What? You don't drink?
._LUCY
.:I don't know.
.((beat)
>:I kind of got this impression that
>:you had cut down on that. You know,
>:with the training and the waking up
>:early and the big fight where I
>:destroyed a bunch of liquor
.:bottles.
._TONY
.((laughs)
>:Oh, I have! But I still get drinks!
.:Two a day is a big step for me.
>.She shrugs and looks bemused. What is she getting herself
..into?
._LUCY
.:All right. Where do you want to go?
._TONY
.:I have a spot. 
>.Lucy gathers up her things and starts walking with Tony
..towards his car.
._TONY
>:By the way, Benny is still furious
>:at you for what you did to his
.:store.
.\Int. dive bar - night
>.Tony's bar of choice is a bit grimy, a bit rundown--a real
>.old-time Oakland spot. Nothing trendy or glittering here. A
>.diverse mix of older men sit around at a few tables and at
..the bar. An old jukebox plays classic rock.
>.Lucy, changed out of her suit,  walks in with Tony and
..stops, looking around.
._LUCY
.:This is where we're having a drink?
._TONY
>:This place is great. Never had a
.:bad drink here.
>.The bartender, OSCAR, a tough-looking older white man
..wearing a baseball cap, spots Tony.
._Oscar
.:Tony! How the hell you doing?
._TONY
.:I'm good, Oscar! Good to see you!
._LUCY
.((aside)
>:I feel like they should be playing
.:Bad to the Bone in here.
._TONY
.:There's a jukebox over there, Lucy.
..They approach the bar and sit down.
._OSCAR
>:Been a while, T. I was wondering
>:what happened to you. This your
.:daughter?
._TONY
.:My niece.
._OSCAR
.:I didn't know you had a sister.
._TONY
>:Yeah, you never met her. Lucy here
.:is just visiting.
._OSCAR
>:You got some kind of uncle,
>:darling. You 21? I take the age
.:limit very seriously here.
._LUCY
>:Yeah! I have my ID in here, unless
.:I left it at home...
..Oscar holds up his hand.
._OSCAR
>:Relax! It's fine, you're fine. I
>:don't give a shit. Have anything
.:you want.
._LUCY
.:Okay. How about a gin and tonic?
._TONY
.:Bourbon on the rocks for me.
._OSCAR
>:You'll be in hell someday for
.:putting ice in my bourbon.
..Lucy turns to Tony.
._LUCY
>:Am I supposed to be impressed
>:you've never had a bad drink here
.:if you order that?
._TONY
.((shrugs)
.:You can't screw up liquor and ice!
._LUCY
>:I'm just surprised you would settle
.:like that.
._TONY
.:Settle?
._LUCY
>:Yeah. For something...pedestrian. I
>:guess I thought your high standards
.:extended to everything.
>.Tony looks at her, then looks ahead and takes a long drink
..from his bourbon.
._TONY
>:I've settled for a lot of things,
.:Lucy.
._LUCY
>:Just because your apartment is
>:small or your clothes are ratty
>:doesn't mean you've settled for
.:something. 
._TONY
>:Well, you don't understand the
>:choices I've made. And by the way,
>:thanks for the dig at my clothes
.:and apartment.
._LUCY
.((smiles)
>:Really thought you were gonna let
.:that slip by.
._TONY
>:Despite everything that has
.:happened, I still have some pride.
._LUCY
>:But not in your drink order,
.:apparently.
..Tony looks playfully shocked.
._TONY
>:Now you're the one lecturing me
.:about drink orders?
._LUCY
.:Oh, I'm not lecturing.
._TONY
>:You don't know how to drink. And
>:what they teach you in college
>:doesn't count. Shotgunning beers is
>:like being a champion at kickball:
>:only kids at a very specific place
.:in their lives care about it.
._LUCY
>:You know, I don't feel like I've
>:had any time to do that. It's
>:always classes, or LSAT, or working
>:at the store, or taking care of
.:this and that.
._TONY
.((beat)
>:Lucy, how have you been doing all
>:that while keeping up with our
.:lessons?
>.For the first time, Lucy takes a long swig from her drink.
..Becoming more like the mentor.
._LUCY
.:I haven't.
._TONY
>:You can do more to help Chinatown
>:with a briefcase than with your
>:fists. You should be studying with
.:your professors, not with me.
._LUCY
>:I know you're probably right. It's
>:what everyone tells me, and how can
>:everyone older than me be wrong?
>:But I can't just spend years and
>:years of my life just going to
>:school, and then striving for
>:partnership, and making myself
>:money, while saying that some day
>:I'll get to helping our community.
>:Telling myself that some day I'll
>:do what I actually set out to do,
>:but first I have to get a BMW.
>:First I have to score high on the
.:entrance tests.
._TONY
>:That's what us old folks are
>:counting on. We want you to get out
>:and make it. We want one of our
>:people out there pulling the
.:strings.
._LUCY
>:I see plenty of those people in my
>:classes. But I don't think of this
>:place as an eventual talking point
>:in my memoirs or a sob story on my
.:admissions essays. 
._TONY
>:Maybe you should. You'd be better
>:out there. You're a wanderer. A
.:refugee without a homeland.
..Lucy looks around the bar.
._LUCY
.:This is my homeland. And yours.
._TONY
>:You think so. I don't like it very
.:much. I aim to leave.
._LUCY
.:I'm not trying to leave, Tony.
._TONY
>:Well, that's the best way to not
.:get killed.
._LUCY
.:*You're* not dead.
>.Turning the conversation to him upsets Tony. An unusual view
..of such a composed man. He finishes off his bourbon.
._TONY
.:We, uh...don't have the same...
>.He looks around and pulls out a flask, pouring some into his
>.glass. He pauses, the words oozing out of him slowly, like
..blood from a wound.
._TONY
.:I never really...
.((beat)
>:...tried in that way. I didn't have
>:much courage. It's been a long time
.:since I've, uh tried...
..Perceptive as always, she tries to rescue him.
._LUCY
>:Do you want to grab a table? I'd
.:rather not just sit at the bar.
._TONY
.:Let's refill our drinks first.
..She raises her hand for the bartender.
._LUCY
.:Excuse me, sir?
._OSCAR
.:What's up?
._LUCY
.:Can we get another one each?
._OSCAR
>:Sure, yeah. Another one for you,
.:Tony?
._TONY
.:Yes.
>.He refills them, Tony looking straight ahead, Lucy glancing
..at him every so often. Her anticipation is electric.
..Tony gets his bourbon first and starts upon it immediately. 
>.When Lucy gets hers she takes a sip and gets up to find a
..table in the back.
>.She looks for Tony and sees him still at the bar. She walks
>.up to see he's already finished his drink and has ordered
..another.
>.Lucy goes back and sits down alone. Waiting nervously.
>.Expecting something huge. She sips the gin and tonic from a
..straw. 
>.Eventually Tony sits down next to her, a little bit
..unsteady. Seemingly a bit more primed to share.
._LUCY
>:When was the last time you fought
.:anyone?
._TONY
>:Anyone? It was 1987. At my wife's
.:funeral.
._LUCY
.((beat)
.:Oh. I'm really sorry.
._TONY
>:Don't be. I won. He said some cruel
.:things and I had to sort it out.
>.A long silence. Lucy tries to think of the best way to
..phrase this. She can't afford to screw this up.
._LUCY
.:So is that the reason that you--
._TONY
>:Don't fight? No! Don't be silly.
>:It's nothing like that. It was
>:because I had a realization. A
>:truly philosophical one. I realized
>:that violence cannot solve your
.:problems. [Improve]
>.Lucy looks surprised. She thought he was about to finally
..share. That she had broken through.
._LUCY
.:That's why?
..Tony now looks uncommonly cheerful.
._TONY
>:Oh yes. I looked at my life's work,
>:and I, I saw that it was all about
>:violence. Perfecting it, teaching
>:it, living in it. And it offended
.:me philosophically.
._LUCY
.:Philosophically?
._TONY
>:Violence is bad for society, it's
>:bad for everyone, aggressors and
>:victims. I couldn't live like that.
>:I hung up my robes and quit the
>:life. Never looked back. And ever
>:since then I've refused every
>:invitation to return. And that's
>:why I feel secure now. I feel
.:totally secure in my decision.
>.Lucy slumps back, bitterly disappointed by his lies. She
>.lost the moment, the one moment for real connection. The
..wall is back up, but it has a cheerful face now.
._LUCY
>:Well, that's very principled of
.:you, Tony.
._TONY
>:And I still think your mission
>:won't work because of that. You
>:really will accomplish much more if
>:you give it up and take a, uh,
>:peaceful approach. Even with
>:Clarence Tran. That's why I've said
>:everything I've said. Maybe you can
.:understand now.
>.She's dejected now. She can't bear to listen to more
..falseness.
._LUCY
>:I understand. It's late, Tony, I'm
>:gonna head home. I'll be pretty
.:busy tomorrow.
..She stands up, her gin and tonic half-finished.
._TONY
>:Ok. That's good, then. You need
>:your sleep, you're looking tired.
>:And it will help us in our lessons,
.:too.
._LUCY
>:Thanks for the concern. See you
.:tomorrow.
..She walks straight out, quickly, not looking back.
>.Tony's pleasant face slowly slips. He seems nervous now,
>.wondering how well he performed. Whether he's put this topic
..to rest.
>.He gets up suddenly from the table. His glass falls on the
..ground and breaks.
.\EXT. Donna's store - night
>.Woojin and Nico sit inside an old sedan, watching the
>.exterior of Donna's store. Woojin smokes a joint. The radio
..plays softly. The streets look deserted.
._WOOJIN
>:God, it's like this bitch never
>:leaves. I thought her shift was
.:over at 2.
._NICO
.:She is very dedicated.
..Woojin takes another drag from his joint.
._WOOJIN
>:I'm starving, man. We still got
>:that chocolate croissant from
.:Peet's?
._NICO
.:Should be in the back.
>.Woojin leans over the chair and rummages through the bag. He
..strikes gold.
._WOOJIN
.:Aw, yes. Just what I needed.
>.He loudly crinkles the bag and pulls out the croissant. He
..bites into it.
._WOOJIN
>:Mmmm. Oh my god. This is fucking
>:amazing? Like, how do they get the
.:pastry to be so buttery and flaky?
._NICO
.:Butter, probably. 
._WOOJIN
.((points to croissant)
>:This is a work of art, Nico. You
.:can never forget that.
._NICO
>:A work of art that lasts five
.:minutes and is gone.
._WOOJIN
>:That makes it even more beautiful!
>:It's fucking transitory! Temporary!
.:Like, uh...
._NICO
.:Ephemeral?
._WOOJIN
.:Fucking right.
..He finishes it off.
>.Through the window, they see Lucy open the door and step
..out.
._WOOJIN
.:Look, look, check it out!
>.Lucy says goodbye to Donna, who stays in the store and dims
..the lights.
._WOOJIN
.:Fucking finally, man.
..Lucy walks around the corner and ducks into an alley.
._WOOJIN
>:All right. Let's collect it and get
.:out of here.
..The two men get out of the car. They approach the store.
._LUCY (OS)
.:Stop there!
>.They look to see Lucy peeking out of the alley, watching
..them closely. 
._WOOJIN
.:What's your problem?
..Lucy steps out of the shadows towards them.
._LUCY
>:I know what you're doing. I've seen
>:you guys waiting out there since
.:1:30.
._WOOJIN
.:Yeah. We were doing you a favor. 
._LUCY
.:By robbing Donna blind?
..Woojin smiles wearily. 
._WOOJIN
>:Listen, this is starting to really
>:annoy us. Go home, all right?
.:That's all we want to do.
..Lucy puts down her bag and jacket.
..Woojin looks at Nico, confused.
..Lucy raises her fists, ready to fight, and approaches them.
._WOOJIN
.:What the fuck--
>.Lucy STRIKES him quickly, knocking him down with a one-two
..hit.
..Nico helps up his friend, who wipes blood out of his mouth.
._WOOJIN
>:Girl, what the fuck is wrong with
.:you?
..Lucy steels herself. Gives him nothing.
..Woojin gathers himself, then attacks with a cry.
>.She parries his punch, then kicks him in the legs. Woojin
..yelps comically.
..Nico attacks suddenly. She barely avoids his swing.
..Woojin hits, and connects, but there isn't much force.
._NICO
.:That's your hit?
._WOOJIN
.((indignant)
.:It's got some power!
>.Lucy gathers herself and backs up. The two men, now seeming
..much bigger than her, close in.
>.Lucy backs into the alley next to the store. It is covered
>.with enormous, beautiful graffiti. Oakland street murals. A
>.single lamp lights up the alley, their shadows are cast over
>.the walls. There's an old-fashioned metal trashcan behind
..Lucy.
>.Woojin and Nico attack again, awkward and not in rhythm.
..They're not experienced.
..Lucy parries them, trying to duck some of their hits. 
>.Nico gets in a good one on Lucy's arm. Angry, she clutches
..her arm and kicks him right in the chest.
>.Woojin looks surprised at seeing the bigger man pushed
..aside. Lucy takes this opportunity to kick out his legs.
..Woojin is angry now. The stoner vibe is all worn off.
._WOOJIN
.:Jesus fuck!
>.Nico attacks again, this time just pushing Lucy. She's much
..lighter, and she flies back into the trashcan.
>.She picks up the metal lid and brandishes it. She has some
..confidence now.
>.She advances towards them, Woojin and Nico backing off
..slowly. They look stupefied, not badass.
>.She swings right at Woojin but misses. He hits her in the
..belly, awkward but with some venom now.
>.She keels over a bit, but then hits him with the metal lid.
..He goes right down.
>.Nico tries to hit, but she blocks it with the metal lid. He
..clutches his hand in pain. It's almost Three Stooges-esque.
>.While she's occupied with Nico, Woojin, still on the ground,
..pulls on her legs. She falls over.
>.Nico, still clutching his bloody hand, starts kicking her
..pathetically.
>.She grabs the lid and swings it from the ground, striking
..him in the groin. Nico falls to his knees.
>.Now Lucy jumps up, and faces Woojin, who has pulled himself
..off the ground.
>.His face is bloody; he looks unsteady. He half-heartedly
..raises his fists.
._WOOJIN
.:You fucking bitch, we're gonna--
>.Lucy attacks. Her experience is clear now; Woojin is
..outmatched.
>.He puts up a fight, but Lucy gains the upper hand. She
..eventually finishes him off, leaving him on the ground.
>.Lucy looks around at the two men. She walks over to Nico,
..still clutching his balls, and kicks him in the face.
._LUCY
.:Don't ever come back to this store.
>.She walks off. She's beaten and bloodied and exhausted, but
..victorious.
.\EXT. Tony's apartment - porch - night
>.Lucy bangs on Tony's door, still bloodied from the fight.
>.After a short wait, the bolt slides and the door opens. Tony
..looks bleary.
._TONY
.:Lucy? What are you doing?
._LUCY
.:I need to come inside.
..He gets a better look at her face.
._TONY
.:What the hell happened to you?
._LUCY
.:I need to use your sink.
..Tony lets her enter for the first time.
>.Lucy stumbles over to the sink and starts blood off her face
..and knuckles.
._TONY
>:Lucy, who did you fight? Don't tell
.:me some bullshit story!
._LUCY
.:Why not! You always do!
._TONY
.:Who did this?
._LUCY
>:I did! Okay? I saw these guys
>:waiting outside Donna's store.
>:Waiting to get more money out of
.:her. I couldn't stand it this time. 
._TONY
.:You attacked Clarence Tran's men?
._LUCY
>:I beat them, okay. You have taught
.:me something, at least.
._TONY
>:I didn't teach you to do that! I
>:didn't teach you to throw away your
>:life like that! I told you you
.:weren't ready yet!
._LUCY
>:According to you I'll never be
>:ready! You've been trying to get me
.:to quit!
._TONY
.:What happened to them? How many?
..Lucy grabs a towel, and attends to herself.
._LUCY
>:There were two of them. I left them
.:bleeding in an alley. 
._TONY
>:So you managed to get yourself
>:beaten up and leave them alive! All
>:without informing me of anything!
.:Why can't you control yourself?
._LUCY
>:I took on his men. Men twice my
.:size. And I won.
._TONY
.:At the cost of this?
._LUCY
>:I actually did what I set out to
>:do. I applied what you've taught
.:me.
._TONY
>:You're not ready! You think these
.:wounds are the end of it?
._LUCY
>:I can actually face the
>:consequences of my actions, Tony.
.:I'm not afraid!
>.Tony rushes over to his cabinet, pulls out a first aid kit,
..and gives her a fistful of bandages.
._TONY
>:Your training is over. Forever. I
.:don't want to see you again.
..Lucy looks straight at him, blood boiling.
._LUCY
>:This is how you respond? When I
.:need you?
..Tony has gone from rage to venomous bile.
._TONY
>:I can't help you. I obviously never
.:could. You've wasted everything.
._LUCY
>:I thought I might have to do this
>:alone. But I didn't think you'd
.:leave me like a coward.
._TONY
.:Go back to the street. [Improve]
>.Lucy grabs some bandages and stuffs them into her bag. She
..leaves and slams the door.
..Tony stands there, fuming for a second. 
>.He looks at a water bottle on the table, then suddenly kicks
..it.
.\EXT. Chinatown street - day
>.Lucy walks down the streets furtively. She has bandaged
..herself up from the previous night. 
>.With every step she glances around; danger lurks behind
..every corner. The streets seem eerily empty.
>.As she gets up to where Donna's store is, she pauses,
..hearing a commotion. Is it an ambush? Did something happen?
..She finally walks around the corner and stops in horror.
..Donna's store is a burn-out wreck. 
>.A firetruck is in front of it, firefighters spraying water
..onto it, with a crowd around the strorefront.
..Lucy runs up to the crowd, all caution gone.
..She sees Wan-Min, standing next to the firetruck, crying.
._LUCY
.:What happened?
._WAN-MIN
>:They think someone burned down the
.:store last night. Donna---
._LUCY
.:Is Donna okay?
..Wan-Min shakes her head, covering her mouth.
._WAN-MIN
>:She's in the hospital. They haven't
>:said how she's doing. But I heard
.:there was gasoline...
..Lucy turns white.
._WAN-MIN (CONT'D)
>:I just don't know how this
.:happened! Why this happened?!
..Lucy looks around the street.
>.Her eyes fix on two kids: the youths from the beginning, who
..terrorized Benny's shop. They're watching.
._WAN-MIN
>:Lucy, what's wrong? Do you know
.:anything about this?
>.Lucy walks quickly away from the scene, towards the youths,
..smoke billowing behind her.
>.The youths look uneasy as she approaches them. They start to
..turn around.
._LUCY
>:I need to tell you something!
>:That's all I want to give you: a
.:message.
..The youths stop and look at her.
._LUCY (CONT'D)
.:Not a beating.
..The youths smirk uneasily.
._YOUTH #1
.:Not with all them cops around.
._LUCY
>:You're running errands, right? So
.:you can deliver a message too.
._YOUTH #1
.:Like what?
._LUCY
>:I want to see him. Clarence Tran.
>:As a concerned citizen. You tell
.:him that.
._YOUTH #1
.:Get the fuck out of here.
._LUCY
>:I'm not a cop. I'm not an
.:informant. I want to talk.
._YOUTH #2
.:He ain't gonna talk to you.
._LUCY
>:If he doesn't, I'll take down
>:everyone I can find who might be
>:connected to him. Starting with you
.:two.
..The two youths laugh nervously.
._YOUTH #1
.:Alright, we'll tell him. 
._LUCY
>:I'll be waiting tonight by the
>:docks. The Shoreline Park by the
.:Middle Harbor. [Real park name?]
..Their eyes widen. 
._LUCY (CONT'D)
.:Tell him that.
..She turns around confidently.
>.Lucy clenches her fists, opening up her scars and staining
..the bandages wrapped around them red.
.\EXT. OAKLAND DOCKS - night
>.Lucy stands in a red tracksuit on a hill, wind flapping her
>.hair, the lights of San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge
..behind her. 
..She checks her watch. 12 am. No sign of them.
>.She looks up at the sky, looking for stars. She only sees a
..plane light, flying over the Bay.
>.She stares at it for a while, then starts. A retinue of
>.three cars are pulling up in the dark street in front of
..her.
..Lucy goes down the hill. 
>.Five tough-looking men pile out of the front and back cars
..each.
>.The men surround Lucy in a large semicircle, her back to the
>.hill. She stares them down. Alone in front of this private
..army, she has never looked smaller.
>.Out of the middle car climbs Woojin, then Nico, both
..bandaged.
..And Clarence Tran. 
..Lucy's eyes widen. It's the moment she's been waiting for.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:When I heard about your actions
>:last night I was convinced it was
>:some sort of trick. Or joke.
>:Nothing serious. My two men here
>:told me you were insane. That you'd
>:snapped. That I didn't believe. I
>:thought there was a method to your
>:madness. We took some action last
.:night, just in case.
..Clarence steps forward towards her.
._CLARENCE TRAN (CONT'D)
>:But when I heard your message
>:today? I thought maybe they were
>:right. That you have a death wish.
.:Or a big tumor in your brain.
..He nods his head. The men behind him pull out some guns.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:I had to come. Just to find out for
>:myself. I've never heard of
>:anything like this. I could have
>:had these boys take care of it, but
>:I would be missing history. The
>:strangest story of my life. So tell
.:me: what's the truth here?
._LUCY
>:It's very simple. I came here to
>:tell you I'm taking you down. You
.:and all your men. Everyone.
..The men laugh. Clarence doesn't.
..He just jerks his head towards her.
..Two men step forward, brandishing PISTOLS.
..Lucy does nothing. She shows no fear.
>.They grab her and force her to her knees. One searches her
..pockets, and pulls out a wallet. Nothing else.
>.The man carries the wallet over to Clarence Tran, while the
..other keeps her down. She stares at Clarence.
..He opens the wallet and looks at it. 
..Disbelief. 
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:So it's true.
..Woojin crowds around him to read.
._Woojin
.:Lucy Mao? A student at SFSU?
..Clarence pulls out three dollars from her wallet.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:I thought they were mistaken when
>:my background check said you were a
.:college student.
._WOOJIN
.:Are you fucking serious, man?
._LUCY
>:That's right. I'm not wearing a
>:wire. I'm not a cop. No one else
>:knows I'm here. I'm just a
>:concerned citizen. I'm going to end
.:you.
..For the first time, Clarence Tran smiles.
..The man holding her down cocks his gun.
._LUCY
>:You can just kill me now. I'm not
>:afraid to die here tonight. But I
>:can't do it without fighting you
.:first.
>.Clarence looks impassive. Is it shock on his first, or
..amusement, or satisfaction?
._WOOJIN
>:Boss, we should just kill her. It
.:would be so easy.
._NICO
.:I do have to agree with him.
._LUCY
>:I've heard so much about you. About
>:your ruthlessness, your legendary
>:viciousness. And now you can't even
>:fight a college girl? You're going
>:to have someone else pull the
.:trigger for you? 
._WOOJIN
>:He should pull the fucking trigger
.:now.
._LUCY
>:Some legend you are. Some way to
>:end the strangest story of your
.:life. Don't you want to try it?
._NICO
.:There is nothing to be gained here!
._LUCY
.:What kind of a man are you?
._WOOJIN
.:You shut the fuck up!
._LUCY
.:Do it or don't! You fucking rat!
._WOOJIN
.:Don't you---
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:Stop!
>.Clarence Tran looks at them with dagger eyes. Nico and
..Woojin stand back.
..He glances at the man holding Lucy.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:Let her up.
..Lucy stands up, ready to fight.
._WOOJIN
.:You're not really--
>.Clarence turns around lightning fast and hits him on a
..bandaged spot.
..Woojin collapses, whimpering.
>.Clarence turns around to look at Lucy. He takes off his
..glasses and puts them in his suit pocket.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:I accept your challenge.
..The men standing around look shocked.
>.Clarence removes his suit jacket. Lucy looks around the
..circle of men, clenching their guns tightly.
>.Slowly, Clarence unbuttons his black dress shirt to reveal a
..black T-shirt underneath.
..Lucy looks up. A star peeping from behind a cloud.
..Clarence kicks off his dress shoes, keeping his trousers on.
..Lucy ties up her hair. She's ready. An exterminating angel.
>.His socks now off, Clarence pulls a GUN out of his suit
..jacket and hands it to Nico.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:Shoot any man who dares intervene.
..He turns around to face his men.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.((CONT'D)
>:Not a goddamn soul inside this
.:circle!
..All the men back up a step, faces waxen with fear.
..Clarence faces Lucy. She gives him nothing.
>.He steps toward her. She stands alone in the circle, wind
..from the Bay swaying the grass around her.
..He draws close, not pausing.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:I'll kill you quickly, Ms. Mao.
..Clarence strikes without breaking his stride.
..Lucy dodges, but Clarence attacks again.
>.He is quick and brutal; more unforgiving than Tony, more
..vicious.
>.Lucy struggles to keep up. Every attack she makes is
..smoothly dodged or blocked.
>.Clarence lands a blow. She tries to pull back to gather
>.herself, but Clarence doesn't let her. He does not believe
..in an honorable fight.
>.Clarence is on the offensive now. He attacks with one chop
..after another, Lucy trying to push him back.
>.The mooks begin to relax. Woojin and Nico exchange knowing
..glances.
._WOOJIN
.:Kill that bitch!
._Mook #1 
.:Yeah!
._Mook #2 
.:Get her!
>.Clarence has pushed her up against the hill. Lucy is losing
..her balance.
>.But now she sees an opportunity. Clarence tries a fearsome
..kick, but Lucy dodges.
>.Lucy backs up the hill, and with the extra elevation, she
..uses Tony's jab.
..She HITS Clarence square in the face with the jab.
..Clarence backs up, dazed. 
>.Lucy jumps off the hill and jabs again. This time in the
..chest.
>.Clarence swings wildly, his poise broken. Lucy dodges it
..easily and attacks.
..The mooks are deathly silent.
>.Lucy unleashes a combination move. Clarence backs up, nose
..bleeding. She looks unstoppable now.
..One mook glances around, panicked. Woojin sees this.
._WOOJIN
.:Don't you move, you motherfucker!
>.Clarence's face is twisted in a cold rage. This fight
..offends him.
>.He tries to go back on the offensive, and win back some
..ground. 
>.Lucy just dances around him and pushes him onto the hill. He
..narrowly dodges her finishing hit.
>.The mook can stand it no longer. He breaks out of the
..circle, running towards his master.
..Nico SHOOTS him in the back, not an expression on his face.
>.Lucy glances towards the dead man. She is energized.
>.Confident. She feels the end. That her crazy plan might
..work.
>.Clarence's eyes widen. Leaning against the hill, fear enters
..them for the first time.
..Lucy attacks. It's time to finish him.
..She uses the ___ kick.
..She exposes herself. Her side is wide open.
..Clarence punishes her.
>.He grabs the leg in mid-air, hits it, and rams it against
..the hill.
>.He STRIKES her leg with his elbow, landing with a sickening
..crunch.
..Lucy screams in agony, her head to the sky, leg BROKEN.
>.Clarence stands up straight. He wipes the blood off his face
..and looks down at his prey.
..Lucy can't accept it. She crawls toward him.
>.He turns around, all his coldness back, and walks toward
..Woojin and Nico.
>.Lucy gasps for breath. The clouds above her seem to be
..trapping her. She desperately struggles to pull herself up.
>.She can hear him walking towards her, hear the mooks
..cheering, baying for blood. She is still fighting, striving.
..Through force of will she pulls herself up from the ground.
..Just in time for Clarence to bury his KNIFE into her chest.
..And Lucy falls, slowly, back down to earth.
..The city lights shimmer on the Bay.
..The waves gently scrub the shore.
.\INT. TONY'S APARTMENT - DAy    
>.Sunlight beams through the curtains, waking Tony up on the
..couch.
>.He's wearing the same clothes he did last night, when Lucy
..told him about her fight with Nico and Woojin.
>.He stretches and looks at his kitchen table, littered with
..empty beer and bourbon bottles.
..He splashes water in his face.
.\EXT. CHINATOWN STREET - DAY
..Tony, changed, steps slowly out of his apartment.
..The streets seem quiet today.
..He rounds the corner and sees Donna's store. 
..Torched.
>.The firetrucks have left. He realizes what has happened, and
..what Lucy might do.
.\SERies of shots
..-Tony, panicked, runs up to the burned-out store.
>.-Tony talks to Wan-Min, who points the direction Lucy went
..in.
..-Tony runs around the streets of Chinatown.
>.-Tony gesticulates to Benny, who shakes his head. He hasn't
..seen her.
>.-He closes the door of the hospital room Donna is in as
>.doctors rush in. From his face we see what has happened to
..her.
..-Tony sits in front of unsympathetic police.
>.-He sits alone at the dive bar, with no drink, at the same
>.table he once sat with Lucy. The chair next to him is
>.conspicously empty; a folded-up newspaper is in front of the
>.empty chair. We can see enough of it to determine what it
..says.
.\EXT. CHINATOWN STREET - night
>.Tony sits in a car outside of the fancy restaurant, Carollo
..Ristorante, that he and Lucy ate at. 
>.Food wrappers and a few empty cans of energy drink litter
..his car. He has been staking out here for quite some time.
>.There is a gala going on tonight at the restaurant. People
>.in suits walk in and out of the restaurant, with a grand,
>.lit-up entrance, complete with balloons, a carpet, and a
..banner reading "FUNDRAISER SIGN."
>.Tony carefully watches the mingling guests, noticing the
>.occasional guard in suits standing around the restaurant:
..the mooks who watched Lucy die.
..The radio is on. 
._Radio announcer (VO)
>:...The Warriors have extended their
>:winning streak to 10 games with
>:last night's victory in LA against
.:the Lakers. 
>.A group of cars pull up to the restaurant. Everyone outside 
..the restaurant starts crowding around the entrance.
..Clarence Tran's entourage. Tony perks up, eyes alert.
._RADIO ANNOUNCER (VO)
>:Meanwhile, authorities are
>:continuing the search for Lucy Mao,
>:an Oakland native and SFSU student
>:whose body was found floating in
>:San Francisco Bay five days ago.
>:Anyone with knowledge of this case
>:should report it immediately to the
.:Oakland Police Department.
>.Tony sees a few mooks step out, with Woojin and Nico leaving
..the center car. 
..Clarence Tran and Sylvia follow, in suit and evening dress.
>.Sylvia smiling and Clarence stone-faced, they walk up to the
>.door and are greeted by the owner, Pauly Carollo. Clarence's
..thugs take up posts outside the restaurant.
._PaulY carollo
>:Sylvia, it's so good to see you!
.:And Clarence, how are you?
._SYLVIA
>:Thank you so much for hosting this.
>:How has everything been going so

._PAULY CAROLLO
>:Oh, excellent. Turnout is great,
>:everyone lives the food, the music,
.:the vibes.
._SYLVIA
>:Of course they do, it's your
.:restaurant!
._PAULY CAROLLO
.((laughing)
>:We're gonna raise a lot of money
>:for ___ tonight. This was a great
.:idea on your part.
._SYLVIA
>:Well, Clarence did help me with the
.:planning.
..Clarence doesn't even pretend to smile.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:I just try to help her passions
.:whenever I can.
._PAULY CAROLLO
>:Why don't you come inside? I have
.:some people I want you to meet.
..Clarence glares at Sylvia, who shrugs.
._SYLVIA
.:It won't last long, I promise. 
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:I'll make sure of that.
._SYLVIA
.:Clarence, it's just one night.
..Pauly pauses in the doorway.
._PAULY CAROLLO
.:Are you coming?
._SYLVIA
.:Yes, we are.
..They follow him into the restaurant.
>.Tony stares at them from his car, eyes filled with rage. He
..glances around, checking the guards one more time.
>.One of the guards steps away from the restaurant for a
..second. He sticks a cigarette in his mouth and lights it.
>.Out of the darkness a foot HITS him in the face, knocking
>.the cigarette into his mouth. [Is a kick too ridiculous, so
..that the foot should be replaced with a fist?]
..Tony emerges from the darkness.
..He kneels down and finishes the guard with his elbow.
>.One of the other guards notices and alerts a guard next to
..him.
>.Tony runs toward them and takes them both out almost
..instantly. 
>.He is brutal and violent; all his old grace replaced by the
..single-minded will to kill.
>.The guests standing outside panic and run. Tony stands in
>.the middle of the confusion and approaches the door, with
..two terrified guards flanking it.
>.Tony quickly takes out the first, then BREAKS the arm of the
>.second with a loud crunch, and SMASHES the man's face with
..his knee.
.\INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT
>.In the back of the restaurant, Clarence, Sylvia, and Pauly
>.stand talking to a gaggle of guests. They hear screaming and
..commotion from the front.
._PAULY CAROLLO
.:What's going on over there?
._SYLVIA
.:I don't know, I--
..She looks at Clarence, who is alert now.
._SYLVIA
.:Honey? [Different word for honey?]
.\Int. Fancy restaurant - lobby - night
>.Back at the front of the restaurant, three mooks attack
..Tony.
>.He takes down the first with a laser-precise jab to the
>.groin, then another with a kick to the leg and strike to the
..face.
>.The third one grabs a knife, but Tony grabs a wine bottle
..from a table next to him. 
..He BREAKS the wine bottle on the goon's head. 
>.Tony buries the jagged end of the bottle into the man's
>.stomach, disemboweling him. The man shrieks as his insides
..go flying. Tony's rage is incandescent now.
>.Still holding the jagged, now bloody wine stub, Tony sees
>.another man approaching, and tosses the bottle at his face.
..The man collapses, glass shards in his eye. 
>.Woojin runs out on the other side of the restaurant with
..Nico and finally spots Tony.
._WOOJIN
.:Who the fuck is this guy?
>.Tony runs over, and without looking down, STOMPS the shard
..into his brain.
..Woojin and Nico look at each other, horrified.
._WOOJIN
>:You hold him back for a bit! I
.:gotta go tell Clarence!
.\Int. Fancy restaurant - night
>.Clarence has gotten up from his dinner table in a private
>.room in the back. He walks towards the front as the
..restaurant empties out. Sylvia is behind him.
._SYLVIA
>:Clarence, what the hell is going
.:on?
..Woojin runs in.
._WOOJIN
>:Boss, there's some kind of--crazy,
>:kung fu Bruce Lee motherfucker
>:here. He's killing everyone. We
.:gotta get you out of here now!
..Pauly flees immediately. Clarence glares at him.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:Don't you run!
>.Sylvia looks horrified. Clarence runs up and grabs the
..terrified Pauly.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.((CONT'D)
>:You got any weapons in this place?
>:Shotguns, pistols, anything better
.:than a knife?
>.Pauly whimpers. Clarence looks down at Pauly's pants, then
..looks up again.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:Tell me now.
._PAULY CAROLLO
>:There's, there's a pistol in my
.:desk. Second shelf.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:Good.
..He tosses Pauly aside, who scurries away.
._SYLVIA
.:Clarence?
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:Sylvia, you have to get out of
.:here.
._SYLVIA
.:I don't understand...
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:This is my job! How do you think
>:you afford that fucking dress and
.:that fucking house?
._SYLVIA
.:But you're in danger--
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:You have to leave. I'll take care
.:of this.
..Sylvia stands up, stronger.
._SYLVIA
>:I'm not leaving you. I am your
.:wife.
..Clarence glances at Woojin.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:Get her out.
>.As Woojin grabs her, Clarence walks towards the back of the
..restaurant.
.\INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - LOBBY - NIGHT
>.Tony takes out two more mooks. Dead or broken men lie behind
..him.
>.Nico picks up a steak knife from one of the tables and
..approaches him.
>.He stabs at Tony, but he dodges it and strikes the big man
>.in his legs. Nico withstands it and jumps onto Tony,
..SMASHING a table.
>.Now on top of Tony, Nico tries to stab him again, but Tony
>.grabs his hand before Nico can thrust. The much smaller Tony
..twists out of the lock, knees Nico, and flips him over.
>.Nico struggles, but Tony knocks the knife out of his hand
..and grabs it.
..He throws it at another mook coming behind his back.
>.Tony strikes Nico in the throat and jumps up, then kicks his
..teeth out.
>.Just one thug left in the front room. A shrimpy looking
..white guy, standing in front of the door.
>.[Tarantino paid homage to Yojimbo with the line "Go home to
>.your mother!" In the Bride's fight scene. If only he hadn't
..already used that hilarious line.]
>.Tony walks to the door, glaring at him. The thug weakly
..opens the door for him. Tony goes through it without a word.
>.[Perhaps the humor of this would distract. It could be done
>.in a non-humorous way, where Tony just runs right past the
..guy, who quickly opens the door for this badass man.]
.\INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT
>.The back room is empty. Tony notices the hallway in the
..back, and goes towards it.
.\Int. fancy restaurant - office - continuous
>.Clarence bursts into Pauly's office, going over to the desk.
..He opens the second one and finds a pistol, but no ammo.
.\Int. fancy restaurant - hallway - continuous
>.Tony is attacked by a mook in the hallway, who he brutally
>.destroys. Another bursts out of the kitchen and attacks Tony
..from behind, but after a short struggle he is taken out too.
.\INT. fancy RESTAURANT - office - CONTINUOUS
..Clarence pulls out drawers frantically, searching for ammo.
.\INT. fancy RESTAURANT - hallway - CONTINUOUS
>.Tony stalks throught the dark, abandoned halls. Approaching
>.Pauly's office, with a prominent door and glass window, Tony
..is suddenly attacked by Woojin, wielding a cleaver.
>.Woojin strikes emphatically, but misses and embeds the
..cleaver in the wall.
>.Tony takes him out and grabs the cleaver, holding it against
..Woojin's neck.
._WOOJIN
.:Wait! Wait, please don't--
._TONY
.:Is Clarence in there?
._WOOJIN
.:What do you want? Jesus, I--
._TONY
.:Who killed her?
._WOOJIN
.:What?
._TONY
.:Lucy! Did you kill her?
._WOOJIN
.:Clarence...
..His eyes dart towards the office.
>.Tony glances at it, then chops open Woojin's throat with the
..cleaver, as if slaughtering a chicken.
>.Still clutching the bloody knife, he runs up to the door of
..the office and kicks it open.
.\INT. fancy RESTAURANT - office - CONTINUOUS
..Clarence stands next to the desk, pointing the gun at Tony.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:Whoever you are, stop there.
..Tony stops, eyes boring into Clarence Tran.
._CLARENCE TRAN (CONT'D)
>:What do you want? What are you
.:doing here?
._TONY
>:You deserve to die. Lucy Mao
.:didn't.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:Lucy Mao? 
._TONY
.:I'm carrying out her last wishes.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:Her father?
._TONY
>:She called me master. But I am her
.:pupil now. [Cheesy?]
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:You can't take me down with your
.:fists. I'll always win with this.
..He gestures at his gun.
..Tony smiles coldly.
._TONY
>:I don't care if I lose. As long as
.:you do too.
..He steps forward, ready to die.
..Clarence pulls the trigger. CLICK.
..No bullets.
..Clarence throws away the gun and puts up his fists.
._CLARENCE TRAN
>:I'll kill you like I killed your
.:little girl.
..Tony attacks in a fit of rage.
>.Clarence's cold poise is cracked now. Tony's anger is too
..much for him.
>.He attacks relentlessly, wailing on Clarence, who can barely
..block his blows.
>.Clarence tries to run behind the desk for some room, but
>.Tony jumps on it and kicks Clarence in his raised arms, then
..kicks him into the wall.
>.Tony jumps down and attacks again. Every jab, chop, and kick
..is filled with hate.
>.Over and over he hits Clarence, who crumples to his knees.
..With a swift hit he BREAKS Clarence's glasses.
>.Clarence lies back. Defeated. Near death. Tony steps around
..him and grabs his neck.
..Clarence can barely croak out the words.
._CLARENCE TRAN
.:What--
..CRUNCH.
..Clarence Tran collapses, neck broken.
..Tony is not triumphant. Just quiet.
._TONY
.:I'm a killer.
>.Tony stands over his prize, looking small. The restaurant is
>.deathly quiet. This is not a triumphant moment but a tragic
..one. Horrifying, even.
>.Tony steps out of the office, past the crumpled and broken
..bodies of the men he killed. He looks at their faces.
>.He passes through the back room of the restaurant, empty and
>.silent. He looks towards the front, then turns back and
..walks out.
.\Ext. Back of restaurant - night
>.Tony walks away from the restaurant calmly, stepping into
>.the darkness, as a first police car pulls up on the other
..side.
.\Ext. Under freeway overpass - night
>.Tony walks quickly but calmly in the dark, removing his
>.blood-splattered clothes and tossing them into a pile of
>.trash built up by the homeless encampment under the freeway.
>.A sleeping homeless man wakes up and looks, stunned, at this
>.muscle-bound older man tossing aside a shirt covered in
..blood.
>.Tony steps into a dark corner and fishes around for
>.something unseen. He pulls out an old leather suitcase,
>.opens it, and pulls out an old burner phone. As he opens up
>.the suitcase and starts putting on some fresh clothes, he
..dials a number on it.
._TONY
.:Hi Reid? It's Tony.
._Reid (OS)
>:Tony! Glad to hear your voice, my
.:friend.
._TONY
.:It's done. Now's the time to move.
.\Int. Reid's apartment - night
>.Reid sits at his desk, still fully dressed, nervous but
..relieved that his friend has survived his ordeal.
._REID
>:Well if anyone could have pulled
>:this off, it was you. I left the
>:documents and the cash between
.:containers 237 and 238, section 13. 
.\INTERCUT - PHONE CONVERSATION
._TONY
.:You're a good friend. 
._REID
>:I don't suppose I'll ever see you
.:again.
._TONY
.:Not alive.
._REID
>:I mean...so how likely is it that
>:they won't find you? That this
.:works?
._TONY
>:There's no way that it works.
.:That's not the point.
._REID
>:Good luck. I know you'll do what's
.:right.
..Tony looks positively miserable hearing this. 
._TONY
>:I'm just doing what I can to
.:survive.
._REID
.:Good-bye, Tony.
._TONY
.:Good-bye.
..Tony hangs up and smashes the phone under his foot.
.\INT. TONY'S APARTMENT - DAY
>.The door to Tony's apartment is SMASHED open, and two thugs
>.armed with pistols enter, pointing their weapons around,
..seeing no one. 
..Sylvia follows them, with another thug behind her.
>.She's wearing black, with a look of studied anger. Her eyes
..sweep over the apartment quickly.
._MOOK #3
.:He's been gone for a while now.
>.The thugs start looking around, tearing the apartment apart.
>.Sylvia saunters around the flat, looking for some sort of
..clue.
>.The apartment is spotless, cleaner than we've ever seen it.
..No alcohol is visible. 
>.His bedroom look as meticulously clean as the night he
..rejected Lucy.   
._SYLVIA
>:Where could a man like this have
.:gone...?
>.Sylvia looks at his bookshelf, seeing an empty spot where a
..book once was. Then she goes over to the two framed photos.
>.She picks up the first one, showing Tony in robes with his
>.wife. She opens the frame, removes the picture, and places
..it in her jacket.
>.She picks up the other photo, and regards it for a moment.
..This is what she is looking for.
>.She sees Tony with his family standing around a temple arch
..in their native village in China. 
..He's gone home.
.\Ext. Chinese village - twilight
>.The same arch from the photo, now older and partially
>.ruined, stands watch over the sleepy village. A farmer leads
>.an ox into his barn, past an old Toyota truck and a tractor,
>.half-hidden in tall grass. The town feels emptied out of
>.young people gone to seek a new life in the city, with only
..old-timers left to tend the fields.
>.Tony sits alone at an old wooden bar, with a single lamp
>.illuminating the place. He has returned to his haggard look
..from the beginning: stubble, unkempt hair, patchy clothing.
>.Tony finishes his drink of clear liquor on the rocks, sighs,
..and places it down gently.
._TONY
>:One more. Oh come on, promise it'll
.:be the last one.
>.There is no answer from behind the bar. A breeze blows. Tony
>.looks around, tensing up,  and notices the odd lack of
>.movement. The village seems deserted. He realizes what is
..happening and seems to unspool a little bit.
